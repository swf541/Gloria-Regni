restore_holy_mountain_desc;Mount Sinai, where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments has been desecrated by both the Christian and Mohammedan infidels. With the site finally under Samaritan rule, the time has come to restore this sacred place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHH.801;Restoration of the Holy Mountain will begin immediately on Mount Sinai. Care will be taken so that the Sacred place where Moses waited for the Ten Commandments will not be accidently descerated. Your engineers estimate that the restoration will take roughly four years. When it is finished, it will truly be a sight to see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSHH.803;Ever since the fall of the Judges, the Children of Israel had abandoned the Holy Mountain under false pretenses. This time, however, restored by the pious [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], shall never be abandoned!\n\nFrom its position on Mount Sinai, the sacred site shall no longer be defiled by gentile hands, but rather serve as a focal point of worship.

restore_high_priesthood_desc;The office of the Kohen Gadol - the High Priest of Samaritanism - has been vacant since the violent suppression of the Samaritan revolts by the Christian Emperors. Now that the Holy Mountain has been restored, perhaps a new High Priest should be appointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHH.804;There has not been a Kohen Gadol  a High Priest of Samaritanism  since the violent suppression of the Samaritan revolts by the Christian Emperors roughly a thousand years ago. At long last, this position has been filled and the High Priesthood reconstituted.\n\nLike the Samaritan priests of ancient times, the Kohen Gadol was traditionally required to be a descendant of Aaron, the older brother of Moses. Due to a lack of suitable candidates this requirement has been waived, but the new High Priest still enjoys the respect of the Samaritan religious communities, and the Priesthood has moved into and established itself at the Holy Mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
