EVTDESCSIQ.100;You wake suddenly in cold sweat with a strong sensation that something is amiss. The flickering candlelight in your tent reveals a plate of hot biscuits and a note pinned by a poisoned dagger next to your bed. It reads: "Mend your decadent ways before it is too late, [Root.GetFirstName]. The Siqariqim are watching.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASIQ.100;Perhaps the time for change has come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.101;One of your servants, [From.GetTitledName], has been executed by the Siqariqim by having [From.GetHerHis] throat slit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.102;Master, terrible news! Your faithful servant, [From.GetTitledName], has been found dead in [From.GetHerHis] home, no doubt at the hands of the vile Siqariqim. Carved by knife into [From.GetHerHis] chest were the words: "[Root.GetFirstName] - You were warned.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASIQ.102;Oh my...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.103;As you turn a street corner in [Root.Location.GetName], a strange whistling sound swishes past your ear. Your bodyguards topple over, knives in their throats, and before you can react y;;;;;;;;;;;;;xou are surrounded by robed Siqariqim. Their leader approaches you with a sad look on his face. "May you find what you seek in the life hereafter, friend."
EVTOPTASIQ.103;But... but I am not ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.104;[From.GetTitledName] staggers past your guards, bleeding profusely from a dozen stab-wounds. As [From.GetSheHe] collapses in a pool of blood at your feet, [From.GetSheHe] gasps with [From.GetHerHis] last breath: "The S-Siqariqim...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.105;Your guards bring in a covered basket left just outside your palace. Believing it to be confections from one of your subjects, you hungrily pull away the covering blanket only to reveal the severed, gaping head of [From.GetTitledName]. The mark of the Siqariqim has been carved into the forehead.
EVTOPTASIQ.105;I think I've lost my appetite...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.106;As you stroll through your palace garden with [From.GetTitledFirstName], you see the brief glint of reflected sunlight on metal as a thrown dagger flashes past and buries itself in your friend's throat. Your bodyguards rush you to safety, but you glimpse a robed assassin scurrying over the palace walls...
EVTOPTASIQ.106;The Siqariqim! Was I the intended target?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.107;[From.GetTitledName] stumbles into your throne room with a trail of blood following [From.GetHerHis]. [From.GetHerHis] collapses at the foot of your dais with several daggers protruding from [From.GetHerHis] back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASIQ.107;They are monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.108;You wake suddenly in cold sweat with a strong sensation that something is amiss. The flickering candlelight in your tent reveals a plate of hot biscuits and a note pinned by a poisoned dagger next to your bed. It reads: "There are a thousand ways to kill a [Root.GetManWoman], [Root.GetFirstName]. The Siqariqim know them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASIQ.108;Guards! Search the area!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSIQ.109;[From.GetTitledName] has been assassinated by the Siqariqim. [From.GetHerHis] head was decapitated and left for [From.GetHerHis] relatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASIQ.109;No one is safe from the Siqariqim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
