EVTNAME_ExIs_100;Taking of Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ExIs_100;The Jews led by [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] has fought a ten year war to take Jerusalem and the provinces immediately surrounding it from the Arabian Empire. The rise of the Jewish people in their native land has begun. Caliph Al-Mansur isn't happy with the loss of these provinces, but is willing to let the Jewish people alone. \n\nUpon the end of the war, [Root.Liege.GetFirstName] orders a temporary temple to be built on the temple mount. It is built according to the guidelines presented in the Tanakh and will be used as the main temple until the Third Temple can be rebuilt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ExIs_100;A lot of lives were lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_ExIs_101;The HaMashiakh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ExIs_101;Ever since the destruction of the Second Temple by the cruel Romans followed by the conquering of Jerusalem by both Christians and Muslims, we, the faithful Chosen People, have long awaited the HaMashiakh to retake what has been given to us by Yahweh. The Priests of Levi have confirmed your status as the HaMashiakh that has restored the United Kingdom of Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ExIs_101;Blessed be to Yahweh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_ExIs_102;Ben HaMashiakh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ExIs_102;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_ExIs_103;Muslims Expelled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ExIs_103;You have decided to expel all Muslims from your realm. After your guards round the Muslims up, they are forced to depart in a large exodus for lands more friendly to their kind. They are allowed to keep many of their belongings, but you confiscate much of their gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ExIs_103;It shall go to the Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_ExIs_104;Muslims Welcomed Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ExIs_104;Muslims have been banned from your realm for some time, but strangely this seems to have had no effect on many of the malaises they were thought responsible for, such as famines and disease. By now most Muslims seem to have forgiven your offenses, and you have decided to welcome them back with open arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ExIs_104;Mistakes were made. Let us not dwell on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SoA_550;There has not been a Kohen Gadol – a High Priest of Judaism – since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple roughly a thousand years ago. At long last, this position has been filled and the High Priesthood reconstituted.\n\nLike the Jewish priests of ancient times, the Kohen Gadol was traditionally required to be a descendant of Aaron, the older brother of Moses and from the Tribe of Levi. The Priesthood has moved into the living quarters and established itself at the Third Temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_550;Long live the Kohen Gadol!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_ExIs_114;Observance of Yom Kippur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ExIs_114;Yom Kippur is one of the most solemn holy days, since it is the Day of Atonement. Jews across the land pray for forgiveness of their sins and the sins they have done to others. After the restoration of the Third Temple, the original sacrificial system is fully restored. The sacrificial system was ordained by Yahweh in the days of yore when Moses led the Israelites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ExIs_114;Glory to Yahweh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_ExIs_123;Siqariqim Destroyed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ExIs_123;The Siqariqim have become too much of a hassal and have created too much havoc.

The battles raged all across your kingdom as they have been destroyed one holding at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ExIs_123;They deserved it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_ExIs_124;Siqariqim Rebuilt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ExIs_124;You have taken it upon yourself to rebuild the Siqariqim to their former glory. With the Siqariqim rebuilt they can spread fear and dread amongst the enemies of Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
