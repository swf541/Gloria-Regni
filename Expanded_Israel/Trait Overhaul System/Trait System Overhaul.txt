The trait heading will be referred to as the discipline and every trait under it will be learned. Some discipline traits do not have bonuses. For stats and foci that have multiple disciplines, characters can learn up to two disciplines under that stat or can learn two different disciplines under two different stats. Each of the traits is upgradeable to level 4 with the bonus stacking for each level and the minimum stat requirement is met. Tutors will be able to teach up to one level lower or level 1. A child will be able to learn the tutor's non-teaching discipline that takes 6.5 years before they have to find another tutor to learn their second discipline. 

The experience system will be based upon 5 experience gained per year in their entire trait discipline. For second level it will take 10 experience, level 3 would be 20 experience, and level 4 would be 30 experience. These experience points are earned for the entire discipline and their traits.

Experience Table
Level 1: 5 experience
Level 2: 10 experience
Level 3: 20 experience
Level 4: 30 Experience

Each discipline or trait level higher than 1 adds a bonus that is equal to the level 1 bonus for levels 2, 3, and 4. 

The weapons listed are for a duel engine and will provide bonuses once it has been thought out or modified.
