egyptian_pagan_aten_DESC;The religion of Atenism is a Monolatric faith that was focuses on the worship on the god Aten, the Solar Disk. The belief of Aten is traced back to the reforms of the Pharaoh Akhenaten. In daily life they tend to focus on hymns to the Sun Disk Aten and their temples are open in the light, as opposed to the temples of other Egyptian gods who are worshipped in the dark. Unlike other Egyptian faiths they do not practice offerings. They sing praises to Aten, but he does not require any offerings from humans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
egyptian_pagan_isis;Isetite;;;;;;;x
egyptian_pagan_isis_DESC;The religion of Isetism is a reformed form of Kemetism. As the Kemetic faith went through Roman rule, Amun-Ra lost his importance without a pharaoh and soon Isis replaced him as the most important deity. The Isetite faith has been reformed but kept on this path, leading to Isis remaining the Head Goddess and taking the title of Queen of the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
egyptian_pagan_hellenic;Greco-Kemetic;;;;;;;x
egyptian_pagan_hellenic_DESC;The Greco-Kemetic faith is an evolution of the old Egyptian faith that continues the Hellenization put forward by the Greek and Roman conquerers of Egypt. The religion has many parallels to the old Egyptian faith but with many Greco-Roman influences. Amun-Ra is replaced with Jupiter-Ammon, Osiris with Serapis, Anubis with Hermanubis, Horus with Harpocrates and so on. The most important deity is arguably Serapis, ruler of the underworld. The faith has a holy book with chapters on creation, the gods, and epic poetry based on actions of heroes. The church has a standardized liturgy and a formal priesthood and is led by the Pharaoh, who acts as a head of the faith.;;;;;;;x

arabic_pagan_DESC;Arabic paganism is a diverse system of beliefs carried by the nomads of the Arabian desert and rose to be one of the dominant faiths in the Middle East. Arabic paganism is centred on the worship of natural events such as fire and rain, with many regional Gods depending on where you go. When Islam rose in the Middle East, Semitic paganism quickly found itself lost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
arabic_pagan_reformed_DESC;The reformed Arabic faith has a standardized liturgy written in the Arabic script, telling the story of the creation of the world. It is led by the High Priest of Hubal, who traditionally sits in Mecca.;;;;;;;;;x

hellenic_pagan_DESC;The Greco-Roman faith is polytheistic, with large selection of cults and a primary pantheon of twelve major gods including Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Minerva and Vesta. It originated in ancient Greece and with the conquests of Alexander the Great and the rise of the Roman Empire, it would go on to become the dominant religion in the Mediterranean world until the rise of Christendom.;;;;;;;x
hellenic_pagan_reformed_DESC;Hellenic acts as a reformed interpretation of Greco-Roman beliefs and traditions formed into a centralized religion with Neoplatonic and Gnostic influence. It holds a pantheon of multiple gods, with a large focus on Helios as "The One" in a Neoplatonic sense. Helios is represented by a triad: The transcendtal non-sentient World of Forms, Helios-Mithras as the sentient counterpart to the World of Forms and demiurge, and the visible sun who governs our sense-perception world as the third. Jupiter acts as King of the Gods and as the sovereign of our material existence. Priests are expected to live life of chastity, piety is held in high importance and charity is seen as an honourable thing to do. The faith has a formal priesthood with state hierarchy that emulates the Christian priesthood and is led by the Pontifex Maximus, who - much like an Islamic Caliph - is a secular ruler and religious leader of the faithful. Due to the centralization of what are normally ancient beliefs and traditions into a fully fleshed out religion, it no longer holds the usual tolerance for syncretization the Greco-Roman world was known for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_invictus_DESC;The belief of Sol Invictus is a centralized evolution of the classical Greco-Roman religion. The faith ranges from Polytheism to Henotheism, and is focused on the worship of Sol Invictus, the Unconquerable Sun. The head of the religion is the Solar Emperor.;;;;;;;x
germanic_pagan_DESC;The ancient Germanic belief system is a group of related cults and beliefs held by the Germanic tribes of Central and Northern Europe. A pantheon of gods under the wise warrior god Wodan rules all the branches of the worldtree, Yggdrasil. The other two main gods are Thunor, friend to mankind, and Yngvi, god of fertility.;;;;;;;;;;;x

norse_pagan_DESC;The Norse faith is a collection of beliefs and practices peculiar to the far north, almost parallel to the Germanic faith yet tempered by the harsh realities of life in distant Scandinavia. A pantheon of gods under the wise warrior god Odin (or Wodan) rules all the branches of the world tree, Yggdrasil. The other two main Gods are Thor (Thunor), friend to mankind, and Frey (Yngvi), god of fertility.;;;;;;;;;;;x

egyptian_pagan_DESC;The ancient Kemetic faith is polytheistic, with a large selection of gods and cults. It originated in eastern Africa and rose to be the dominant religion of the region until the rise of the Roman Empire. Over time under Roman occupation the Egyptian faith became a shadow of its former self. Without a Pharaoh, temples lost much of their funding, Isis replaced Amun-Ra as the most important deity, and traditions became much more local with local cult leaders and local celebrations replacing the extravagant festivals of old. By the third century, all temples but one had forgot how to read and write hieroglyphs. Due to this decentralization of the faith, Christianity was able to easily rise in the region, however it remained a relevant faith among the only partially Christianised Beja until the rise of Islam.;;;;;;;;;x
egyptian_pagan_reformed_DESC;The Amunite religion is a centralized rebirth of the old Kemetic faith. It is polytheistic, with a large selection of gods and cults. The faith is centralized with the pantheon led by Amun-Ra, King of the Gods.

celtic_pagan_DESC;Celtic paganism is an ancient belief system that is natively practised by the Celtic peoples of Europe. A belief system in a pantheon of gods and a world full of spirits was present who rule the Skies, the Earth and the Otherworld. There was also a belief in the spiritual and healing powers of the earth and the water. Members of the priestly class are known as the Druids, and are responsible for organising rituals, sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedures.;;;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_pagan_reformed_DESC;The reformed Druidic religion has a standardized liturgy written in the Ogham script, with a holy book detailing the gods, creation and stories sacred to the faith. The faith has a formal priesthood with state hierarchy and is led by the Circle of the Druids with the Arch-Druid as the religious leader of the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
