EVTDESC_URO_700;Invitations have gone out to your vassals asking them to join you in this winter's Urgoiena festival. You have decided to make the festival this year a special one, remembered by both gods and men for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_URO_701;I will be there.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_URO_701;I will have nothing to do with that nonsense!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_URO_702;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has declined your invitation to attend the Urgoiena festival! Apparently [From.GetSheHe] has no faith in Mari, Akerbeleltz  and the other gods, and instead follows the strange rituals of some other religion that is foreign to our ways.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_URO_702;A foolish mistake.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_URO_704;At last, the time of the Urgoiena festival is upon us. The night comes early during the winter months, but when darkness begins to set in your liege's servants light the bonfires that have been prepared.;;;;;;;;;x
