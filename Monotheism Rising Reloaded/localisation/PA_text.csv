EVTNAMEPA.10037;Fall of Thessalonika;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10037;The city of Thessalonika has finally fallen to our forces and accepted [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s rule. Named after Thessalonike, the wife of the diadochi Cassander, the city of Thessalonika flourished under Roman rule. It was one of the few cities in Greece which was able to resist the Slavic incursions in the 8th century, owing to it's strong defences. The second largest city in Greece after Constantinople, Thessalonika will make a fine addition to the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMEPA.10038;Fall of Athens;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10038;The city of Athens has fallen to our forces and accepted [Root.GetTitledFirstName] as it's sovereign. One of the greatest cities of the ancient Greek world, Athens became a part of the Roman Republic in 146 BC and flourished under Imperial rule. The city remained under Roman control even after the losses to the Arabs, who failed to take Constantinople and invade Greece. While Athens may not be as large as it once was, it will still make a fine addition to the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMEPA.10039;Fall of Nicae;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10039;The Nicaen Empire has fallen, leaving ourselves as the true heirs of Rome in the east. The Holy Roman Empire may have the support of the Pope, but we control Constantinople, the New Rome and city of the world's desire. The German pretenders can continue to play emperor, so long as they leave the East to it's true rulers. There are much more dangerous enemies close to home we need to deal with, such as the Muslim infidels who still control the Levant, Egypt and Africa.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMEPA.10071;Fall of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10071;The city of Constantinople has finally fallen to our forces. Our ancestors have been fighting the Byzantines for centuries, but now the conflict is finally over. It was hard work breaching the Theodosian Walls, but the countless treasures which lay behind them more than make up for our losses. Control over the Sea of Marmara will greatly enrich our people and allow us to expand further. A golden age has begun for us, all thanks to [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s leadership.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMEPA.10072;Fall of Thessalonika;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10072;The city of Thessalonika has finally fallen to our forces and accepted [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s rule.

EVTDESCPA.10073;The city of Athens has fallen to our forces and accepted [Root.GetTitledFirstName] as it's sovereign.

EVTNAMEPA.10074;Fall of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10074;The city of Constantinople has finally fallen to our forces. Ever since the Fourth Crusade, the city has been under the control of either the Latin ilk or pretenders to the Empire. The trade which flows through the Sea of Marmara will greatly enrich our people, and Constantinople's strong defences will form a bulwark against eastern threats. The future of the realm is secured, all thanks to [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s leadership.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMEPA.10076;Fall of Nicae;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10076;The Nicaen Empire has fallen, leaving ourselves as the true heirs of Rome and Greece.  We are the true fore-bearers of Hellenistic culture, a fact none can deny any longer. A new golden age of Greek culture will begin under our protection, all thanks to [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s leadership.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMEPA.10181;Fall of Francia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10181;The empire of Charlemagne has fallen. With the loss of so much territory to revolts, independence-minded nobles and foreign powers, it was only a matter of time before Francia toppled and fell. The Pope will need to look for a new protector, as the remnants of the empire fight among themselves for the right to claim the vacant throne. Although Francia may be gone, Charlemagne's memory still lives on, as does his dream of reforging the Roman Empire. Western Europe may see another emperor before too long, Francian or Roman.;;;;;;;;;x
