EVTDESC_SoA_550;There has not been a Kohen Gadol - a High Priest of Judaism - since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple roughly a thousand years ago. At long last, this position has been filled and the High Priesthood reconstituted.\n\nLike the Jewish priests of ancient times, the Kohen Gadol was traditionally required to be a descendant of Aaron, the older brother of Moses and from the Tribe of Levi. The Priesthood has moved into the living quarters and established itself at the Third Temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
