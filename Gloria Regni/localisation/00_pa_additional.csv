sunni_DESC;Sunni Islam is by far the most widespread form of the religion. It is the more orthodox of the two main branches of Islam but the origin of the Sunni-Shia schism was largely political in nature. The Sunnis accepted the first Caliph, Abu Bakr, whereas the Shiites rejected him in favor of Ali. Sunni Muslims hold strictly to the Sunnah - the sayings and actions of Muhammad - as collected in the Hadiths, which form the basis for Sunni jurisprudence. The formal head of Sunni Islam is the (Sunni) Caliph.;;;;;;;;;x 
shiite_DESC;Shi'a is the short form of Shi'atul Ali, or the Party of Ali, which rejected the first Caliph Abu Bakr in favor of Ali, the grandson of Muhammad. Shi'a Islam is the less orthodox of the two main branches of Islam and accepts the idea of intercession by dead Imams on behalf of the living. The formal head of Shi'a Islam is the (Shiite) Caliph.:;;;;;;;;;x 
ibadi_DESC;Ibadism is a moderate form of Islam that was founded twenty years after the death of Muhammad. Ibadis believe that race and tribe do not matter when selecting leaders. Ibadis also reject the notion that Muslims will get to see Allah on the Day of Judgment. In-game, Ibadi is considered a Sunni heresy.;;;;;;;;;x 
kharijite_DESC;The Kharijites are a branch of Islam that was marginalized and repressed early in the 7th century. They believe that any unrepentant sinner is a Kafir, also rejecting the notion of infallibility of the Caliphs. In-game, Kharijite is considered a Shia heresy.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEPA.10424;The Great Schism;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10424;The relationship between the Eastern and Western branches of the Imperial Roman Church has worsened to the point of schism. The Pope has excommunicated the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, who has in turn excommunicated the Pope, destroying the unity of the Mother Church. Tensions between the churches have increased slowly over the years due to various disagreements, such as iconoclasm and the Popes claim of leadership over the Mother Church. Both sides have re-organised themselves and their faithful into two new churches, the Western Roman Catholic Church, led by the Pope, and the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church, led by the Ecumenical Patriarch. In time, the church may be re-united, but for now, Christendom is divided, a fact its enemies will surely take note of.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10425;The coronation of Charlemagne by the Pope has significantly worsened the relations between the Eastern and Western branches of the Imperial Church. Should another event of this magnitude occur, the unity of the Mother Church may be broken.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10428;The conversion of the Byzantine Empire to Iconoclasm has significantly worsened the relations between the Eastern and Western branches of the Imperial Church. Although this schism may yet be healed, the unity of the Mother Church has been seriously damaged.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10430;The relationship between the Pope and the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has worsened to the point were both have excommunicated each other. This act has irreparably worsened the relations between the Eastern and Western branches of the Imperial Church.;;;;;;;;;x 
donatism;Donatist;;;;;;;;;x 
donatism_DESC;Donatism was a Christian sect within the Roman province of Africa that flourished in the fourth and fifth centuries among Berber Christians. Donatism had its roots in the social pressures among the long-established Christian community of Roman North Africa (present-day Berber countries Algeria and Tunisia), during the persecutions of Christians under Diocletian. The Donatists (Named for the Berber Christian bishop Donatus Magnus) were members of a schismatic church not in communion with the churches of the rest of Early Christianity in Late Antiquity.;;;;;;;;;x 
pelagianism;Pelagian;;;;;;;;;x 
pelagianism_DESC;Pelagianism is the belief that original sin did not taint human nature and that mortal will is still capable of choosing good or evil without special divine aid. This theological theory is named after the British monk Pelagius (354–420, possibly 440), although he denied, at least at some point in his life, many of the doctrines associated with his name. Pelagius taught that the human will, as created with its abilities by God, was sufficient to live a sinless life. Pelagianism was popular among smallfolk people and faced crackdown by the Roman Church. It was eventually declared a heresy at the Council of Ephesus in 361, and subsequently suppressed.;;;;;;;;;x 
adoptionism;Adoptionist;;;;;;;;;x 
adoptionism_DESC;Adoptionism is a nontrinitarian theological teaching that Jesus was adopted as God's Son at either his baptism, his resurrection, or his ascension. According to Epiphanius's account of the Ebionites, the group believed that Jesus was chosen because of his sinless devotion to the will of God. Adoptionism was declared a heresy at the end of the 2nd century and was rejected by the Synods of Antioch and the First Council of Nicaea, which defined the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and identified the man Jesus with the eternally begotten Son or Word of God.;;;;;;;;;x 
sabellianism;Sabellian;;;;;;;;;x 
sabellianism_DESC;In Christianity, Sabellianism (Also known as modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism) is the nontrinitarian belief that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son, and Holy Spirit are three different modes or aspects of one monadic God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons within the Godhead—that there are no real or substantial differences among the three, such that there is no substantial identity for the Spirit or the Son. The term Sabellianism comes from Sabellius, who was a theologian and priest from the 3rd century.;;;;;;;;;x 
macedonianism;Macedonian;;;;;;;;;x 
macedonianism_DESC;The Macedonians (Named after Macedonius I, the third archbishop of Constantinople) Pneumatomachi, or Semi-Arians as they were known in Constantinople, were an anti-Nicene Creed sect which flourished in the countries adjacent to the Hellespont during the latter half of the fourth, and the beginning of the fifth century. They denied the Godhead of the Holy Ghost, hence the Greek name Pneumatomachi (Combators against the Spirit). The Pneumatomachi were denounced in 374 by Pope Damasus I, and eventually suppressed during the reign of Emperor Theodosius I (369 - 395).;;;;;;;;;x 
valentinianism;Valentinian;;;;;;;;;x 
valentinianism_DESC:Valentinianism is a Gnostic Christian movement that was founded by Valentinus in the second century AD. Valentinianism was one of the major Gnostic movements, and its influence was extremely widespread, not just within Rome, but also in Egypt, Asia Minor, Syria in the east, and Northwest Africa. Later in the movement’s history, it broke into two schools, an Eastern school and a Western school. Disciples of Valentinus continued to be active into the 4th century AD, after the Roman Empire was declared to be Christian, but was eventually suppressed by Imperial authorities.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEPA.10434;The Territory System;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10434;Some of you may have noticed the "enclaved territory" and "contingent territory" modifiers but not understood what exactly they do in-game, so this event added to make sure you understand what's going on. The territory system decides what provinces in your realm can be reasonably controlled. If a province is not connected to your realm by another friendly province or three sea zones that are next to a friendly province, it will gain the "enclaved territory" modifier. If you do not reconnect the province to your realm within ten years, it will automatically go independent via a hidden event, either under a local noble or a generated ruler. Merchant republics are subject to these rules too, with the exception that they can control any province that has a friendly trade post present.;;;;;;;;;x
