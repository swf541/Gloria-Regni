EVTNAME_JR_2001;Wanderer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2001;A half-naked man, with his clothes torn to shreds, stumbles into your main hall and falls before your throne. His feverish mumbling is barely above a whisper and he points directly at you. Intrigued, you go to the man and listen carefully by putting your ear close to his lips. You are suddenly startled that the man has found an object that has eluded the Jewish people for thousands of years... the Ark of the Covenant. /n/n The man collapses as his last breath escapes from his corpse. You have your guards pick the man up and give him a proper burial. You ascend the dais to your throne and contemplate what the days events have brought you. The words of the dying man haunt your thoughts because this is a monumental decision and undertaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2001;You must search for the Ark!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JR_2001;You have better things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Navi and Ruler pray to Yahweh for Guidance
EVTNAME_JR_2002;Prayer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2002;Your court prophet comes to your chambers one night and rousts you from your slumber. This must be important and you heed his urgings. Together, you both sit in a dark alcove and pray to Yahweh for guidance. The prayer continues well past the dawn of a new day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2002;Blessed are those that listen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#G-d gives both of them a vision of the location of the Ark
EVTNAME_JR_2003;Vision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2003;Your prayers are answered as the Lord gives you and your prophet a vision. You see the mountainous vistas of Negev and a solitary cave that resides within the range the there. You recognize the mountains and the Lord compels you to act upon the vision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2003;We must go...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Ruler prepares expedition and receives another vision.
EVTNAME_JR_2004;Preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2004;You order your alluphs and courtiers to go to various merchants to prepare the expedition. They buy the finest gear and horses, in addition to hiring thousands of workers that will work the dig site, knowing that the very survival of everyone depends upon this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2004;All is going according to plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Expedition leaves for Ark's location.
EVTNAME_JR_2005;Farewell to Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2005;You sit, upon your mighty white steed, at the head of a very long column that is comprised of soldiers, workers, and scholars. The column of men leaves through the arch of the city and marches through the countryside. The banners of your kingdom proudly wave in the lilting breeze that moves the air around you. You are proud of this day and you hope to recover the Ark for your people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2005;We go into the unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Expedition encounters bandits.
EVTNAME_JR_2006;Bandits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2006;You have marched for weeks, it seems, and you seem no closer to finding the cave. However, Yahweh lifts your spirits as you continue forward with your contingent. You ride through a small canyon unaware of the danger that surrounds you. Out of nowhere, the canyon walls bristle with the sounds of arrows and you hear the screams of your men dying behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2006;Try to move past the bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#*An arrow hits you with enough force that you are knocked from your horse. You have been wounded.
EVTOPTB_JR_2006;Attack the bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#*You push your horse and order your men to charge into the enemy lines. It is a glorious battle as you clean the area of the bandits.
#Expedition encounters sandstorm.
EVTNAME_JR_2007;Sandstorm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2007;You and your column have seen nothing but days and days of bleak desert as you head towards your destination. The air picks up from a dead still to moving tons of sand into the air at several hundred miles an hour. You spot shelter just out of reach and you urge your men forward towards safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2007;We must press on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#*A rock slams into your face and knocks you off your horse. You fall to the ground unconscious and wounded.
#*Your horse bolts with you on the back while neighing in terror. You lose your grip on the reigns and fall off him. Your armored feet are stuck in the stirrups while you are dragged behind him. Eventually, the horse collapses on top of you from exhaustion and snaps your right leg in half. You have become maimed. 
#Expedition finally arrives at location.
EVTNAME_JR_2008;Arrival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2008;After all the dangers and the sheer boredom that has marked your journey to date, you have finally reached the mountains and the cave seen in your vision. You order everyone to make camp and prepare to begin the dig. May Yahweh bless you and your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2008;We have arrived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Digging commences and ruler has another vision.
EVTNAME_JR_2009;Second Vision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2009;Weeks have transpired and the dig goes slowly. As you sit inside your tent, you are overcome with a vision of a deep vault within the cave. G-d has shown you the exact route to reach this vault and how to open it. The tiredness and sombre feelings of defeat are driven from your body as you sketch out the exact route to the Ark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2009;Adoni has ordained us to succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Set backs in the dig as impure workers die.
EVTNAME_JR_2010;Cost of Impurity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2010;Work has been slow as casualties mount amongst the workers. In your fervor to get under way, you made the mistake of not ensuring that all the workers were ritually pure.It is amongst these workers that have had the highest casualties. You hope that Yahweh can pardon your sins that put their lives in jeopardy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2010;I'm a fool for not being careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Call for ritually pure workers.
EVTNAME_JR_2011;Purity Matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2011;You discuss the matter with your Kohen HaKhatzer and he writes a letter to the Kohens of the Third Temple for ritually pure workers. The letter is dispatched by courier and you hope that this doesn't slow the dig down. The only thing you can do is pray and hope as you watch the courier recede into the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2011;May Adoni protect him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#New workers arrive.
EVTNAME_JR_2012;New Worker Corps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2012;It's near sunset when the replacement workers finally arrive. You look into their tired faces and you praise them for coming to your aid. You have decreed a break in the work and hold a great feast for them all. They look at you in amazement because of your generosity. For now, all that matters to them is a break from the backbreaking labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2012;Work will recommence when the time is right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Ark is recovered.
EVTNAME_JR_2013;The Ark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2013;You stand before the vault of your vision. Before you, the glorious and beautiful Ark of the Covenant sits before you. Kohens from the Tribe of Levi usher into the vault to begin the journey back to Jerusalem. Their rods fit the slots on the side perfectly and it is lifted off of the pedestal that it has rested on for thousands of years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2013;The Kohens look to be floating off the ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Expedition carrying the Ark encounters a large force of Muslim raiders.
EVTNAME_JR_2014;Raiders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2014;Somehow word has leaked out about your expedition and the Caliph has sent a large force of raiders to intercept your expedition. They swirl from the dunes of the desert in the hope of overwhelming your forces. There are tens of thousands of them. Instinctively, you and your Kohen HaKhatzer pray to G-d for salvation as you draw your weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2014;The Lord is my Shepard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Muslim raiders destroyed by the power of the Ark.
EVTNAME_JR_2015;Raiders Destroyed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2015;During your prayer, beams of light emit from the Ark and hits the raiders. Upon being smote with the light, the raider disappears as if he never existed. Adoni is destroying your enemies through His vessel, the Ark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2015;I shall not want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Ark is carried through the palm covered streets of Jerusalem.
EVTNAME_JR_2016;Return to Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2016;It has been a long time since you have marched out of the gate. Now, you return through the portal and the streets are lined with fresh palm leaves to celebrate the return of the Ark. The Kohens carrying it look splendid as it marches ahead of you. G-d is far more important than you and it is only right that He takes center stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2016;It's good to be home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Ark is finally is installed into the Third Temple in the Holy of Holies.
EVTNAME_JR_2017;Holy of Holies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JR_2017;After the procession, the Ark and your column stand before the beautiful Third Temple. You get off your horse and walk beside the Ark as you both ascend the temple mount. In the distance, you can see the massive gold doors to the Holy of Holies standing open. These doors require 20 to 30 men to open and they are on the outside wall. You stop before you reach there as the Ark continues on. You smile, knowing that the Lord is pleased with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JR_2017;The Ark is where it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
