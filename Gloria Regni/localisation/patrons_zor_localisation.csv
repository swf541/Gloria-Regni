EVTDESC_URO_700;Invitations have gone out to your vassals asking them to join you in this winter's Urgoiena festival. You have decided to make the festival this year a special one, remembered by both gods and men for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_URO_701;Invitation to the Urgoiena festival is sent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_URO_701;[From.GetTitledFirstName], your liege, has invited you to join [From.GetHerHim] for this winter's Urgoiena festival. There you will celebrate the coming of the winter solstice and pay tribute to Mari.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_URO_701;I will be there.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_URO_701;I will have nothing to do with that nonsense!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_URO_702;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has declined your invitation to attend the Urgoiena festival! Apparently [From.GetSheHe] has no faith in Mari, Akerbeleltz  and the other gods, and instead follows the strange rituals of some other religion that is foreign to our ways.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_URO_702;A foolish mistake.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_URO_703;Your vassals have arrived and the time of the Urgoiena festival is upon us. The night comes early during the winter months, but when darkness begins to set in the bonfires you have prepared light up the forest.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_URO_704;At last, the time of the Urgoiena festival is upon us. The night comes early during the winter months, but when darkness begins to set in your liege's servants light the bonfires that have been prepared.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_URO_707;The bonfires have finished burning for this winter, and the feast has come to an end. Your vassals are returning home, but most seem to agree that the Urgoiena festival was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_URO_707;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;x
