EVTOPTA_HRP_1002;Well, I don't like him either;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1020;Guests have arrived from villages throughout the realm, to celebrate the Tawusgerran, The Circulation of the Peacock.  Priests walk throughout the crowds, giving out vials of Holy Water to the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1020;Let's get this party started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1096;The Tawusgerran is over for this time. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] has been properly honored and the realm is looking forward to a bright future under His wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1096;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HRP_1030;The Circulation of the Peacock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1030;The Circulation of the Peacock is about to start, and in accordance with tradition, priests and pious men carry the senjaq, statues of the Seven Archangles in circles around the city, distributing blessings in the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].  To be allowed to carry one of the statues is a honor reserved for only those of great wisdom and piety, as well as an event requiring strength and willpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1030;Today I shall carry a burden for the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1030;I always enjoy watching the Circulation. From a well shaded location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1031;As you carry the heavy senjaq around, you discover that it is rather more heavier that you expected. The unaccustomed weight causes you to stumble, and the idol slips out of your hands and crashes down on top of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1031;Surely that's not a bad omen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1035;As you carry the heavy senjaq around, the weight and the heat begin to take their toll on you. As if in a dream, you begin to hear the voices of the Seven Archangels talking, telling you secrets and mysteries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1035;The wisdom the Seven is revealed to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1037;With each step of the Circulation, more and more of the truth of your religion is reveled to you. Of course this is the proper path, how could any man doubt such a truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1037;For the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1039;What once seemed so heavy at the start now feels as light as feather. Why, you could carry this senjaq around all day if the priests would let you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1039;Strength comes from [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HRP_1040;Veneration of the Senjaq;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1040;After the Senjaq have been paraded around the city, the populace comes forward to present their sacrifices and venerations. You visit each senjaq in turn, praying for the wisdom of the Seven Archangels, venerating them with holy incense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1040;For Wisdom and Honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HRP_1050;Collection of Gifts from the Pious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1050;The final stage of the Festival is the collection of alms and taxes from the pious. Every pious man is expected to give, to aid those destitute and in need. While most give only a few coins, truly pious are expected to provide much more.\n\n As the priests wind their way towards you through the crowd, you reach for your purse. How much in alms should you give today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1050;As much as I can spare, for the people need it more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1050;The bare minimum I can get away with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HRP_1050;Give handouts? Bah, those peasants need to get a job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1090;The final ceremony is a grand sermon of thanksgiving to God and his servants. It was a rousing sermon as always, and the crowd begins the feast with great abandon. Another glorious celebration of the Seven Archangels has completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HRP_2113;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2114;Climbing up this stupid rock is a lot harder than it looks. If it was for some loyal retainers, you'd never reach the gathering point. Still, you'll need to have a talk with them. Hoisting a lord over their shoulders like a sack of barley is just not dignified;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2114;Put me down already;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2115;Climbing is hard work, especially on an empty stomach. As you scramble up the path, you spot some red wild berries growing on a stunted bush. The sun is just above the horizon, so it would be sin, yet... so hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2115;It's the white berries that are poisonous, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_2115;They were planted by [Root.Religion.GetEvilRandomGodName] to tempt me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2116;Hiking is thirsty work, and your waterskin has run dry before the sun had set. A fellow compatriot passes you his, and you take a large gulp of the contents. To your surprise, the liquid inside is not water, but a raw kind of alcohol, that leaves your mouth burning and you coughing and sputtering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2116;Hey, this is good stuff;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2117;As you navigate up the heights, your foot slips on a patch of loose gravel, and you lose your balance. Hands reach out to grab you, but not soon enough, as you tumble down the mountain to your death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2117;That was embarrassing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2120;Recent heavy rains have made the mountain side unstable. As you slog through the mud, you hear an ominous sound above you. You turn, and to your growing horror see the land above churning and tumbling towards you. It's a landslide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2120;Run forward and try to beat the slide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_2120;Dive behind a large boulder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HRP_2120;Run down the mountain away from the slide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2121;You collapse, panting and heaving, legs feeling like jelly. Behind you, the rumblings of the earth slow and cease. Somehow, you've made it out alive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2121;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2122;You can not escape as the the very surface of the earth rebels and flows like water. The landslide reaches you and throws you down the mountain side. Miraculously, you survive, if somewhat worse for the wear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2122;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2123;Although the boulder groans ominously as the landslide passes around it, it remains firm, holding you in a small pocket of safety until the roaring stops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2123;Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2124;Not even the weightt of this boulder can stop this landslide. With a sour groan, it crashes down the mountain, burying your broken body in the mud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2124;Just like that old Gypsy woman said!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2130;A bitter cold encases you as you climb higher. By the time you reach the gathering point, two fingers and the tips of your ears have turned black from frostbite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_2130;I should have dressed warmer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_2150;Upon reaching the gathering place high on the mountain, you and your coreligionists celebrate and pray in remembrance of the revelations of the Mahdi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HRP_1600;I shall go on a pilgrimage to attend the Feast of the Assembly at Lalish;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_HRP_1600;I will start making travel plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_HRP_1601;My things are packed, everything is in order. Soon, I shall travel to Lalish and the tomb Sheikh Adi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_HRP_1601;My journey begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_HRP_1621;The rain has been pouring down for days, it's almost impossible to travel the roads. Why does [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] punish his faithful servants so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1621;Blessed is [Root.GetSheHe] who perseveres under trial. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1621;This is absurd - I should have stayed home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1622;You look out across the beautiful valley stretching out before you. It would be a wonderful moment, if not for the fact that there should be no valley here. You are a stranger in an stranger land and you have no idea where you are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1622;If only I hadn't listened to those useless peasants that gave me directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1622;If only I'd listened more to those peasants that gave me directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_HRP_1622;Deep in the night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1623;Sleeping at the pilgrim's inn, you dream a beautiful dream. You are walking through a dense wood, filled with the wonderful sounds and smells of nature. Little squirrels run across your path and birds sing in the trees. You keep walking through the wood, and then you notice a new and strange but familiar smell. You can't quite put your finger on what it is, though. Hmm, it's something you should know, something important... Hmm... yes, it's... it's... it's fire! You are instantly wide awake. The room is hot, you can hear the sound of crackling flames and a moment later you also hear people screaming. Indeed, the inn is on fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1623;Help put it out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1623;Save yourself and let others handle it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1624;They said this was a lawless stretch of road, but you still feel rather unlucky to be in this situation. The robbers are many and armed, and they demand that you pay a 'toll' before you are allowed to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1624;Pay up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1624;Give these scoundrels the only thing they deserve – steel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1625;The old wooden bridge has carried many pilgrims in its day. It creaks suspiciously as you step on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1625;No time to stop, I'm sure it'll hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1625;Stop and help repair it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HRP_1625;These people deserve a stone bridge. I shall pay for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1626;You lay awake at night reflecting on your pilgrimage. It's an inner journey as well as a physical one, but can you be sure of which destination it will take you to? And do you even want to have that certainty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1626;The mind wanders where it will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1626;It's all right there on the map. Time to get some sleep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1627;The journey is long and hard. Your feet are sore, and your back as well. Far from the castle kitchens the food is barely edible, and on top of that you seem to feel cold all the time. Perhaps you were not quite cut out for traveling?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1627;My faith will see me through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1627;Maybe this was a bad idea. I'll stay and rest for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1635;The stories of other pilgrims all spoke of how impressive this place is. Now that you can see it with your own eyes, you can only join in their praise. You are glad that you made the trip to Lalish and the tomb of Sheikh Adi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1635;It was well worth the journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1636;As you walk around on this holy ground, you ponder the secrets and the essence of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. The teachings of the holy church have never felt more relevant to you than now. Imagine the knowledge contained in the scriptures stored here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1636;The way to Heaven is through study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_1636;No, I shall spend my time praying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1637;The tombs, this holy ground, how it all moves my soul! I realize now that all my life up to this point has only been a preparation for this journey. How wondrous that the light of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] truly shines in me, a poor sinner. From now on I shall always do His work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1637;Praise [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1638;Traveling all this way to see the holy places, you had hoped for more than this. It's just lots of people, some tombs and a few bones that really look quite suspicious. Before coming, you had read the exalted stories of other pilgrims, but this just isn't like they described it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1638;That's it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1639;As you approach the holy shrine, you overhear a theological discussion between several priests. You stop and eagerly engage them in conversation, expanding upon several of your favorite topics. They are very impressed by your knowledge and invite you to hold a lecture for a group of assembled religious scholars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1639;I will be most pleased to share my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_HRP_1640;The Ritual Bath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_1640;The first step of the pilgrimage is to purify oneself by bathing the river at Lalish. However, with the influx of so many pilgrims, the water has become quite dirty and rather unhealthy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HRP_1644;Before the Feast of the Assembly can begin, oxen are ritually sacrificed by select Yazidi in a grand ceremony, to declare the arrival of autumn and to ask for rain during winter in order to bring back life in the spring. As an important man of the community, you are expected to donate the funds to help purchase these oxens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_1644;It is my honor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HRP_10200;Trying to reform the Bogomilist Church is like herding cats, as traditional ideals of independence and lay control are strong. Reforming the Church is a lifetime's work, and if you die in the process, your heir will have to start from scratch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_10200;We have to start sometime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_10201;Part of a reformed Church is a unified liturgy, and that starts with ceremonies. Important and impressive ceremonies, that are expensive to pay for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_10201;Every one will want one of these!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HRP_10201;I can't afford it right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_10202;The most important part of any new religion is figuring out what exactly is canon. Bogomil priests from all over the nation use different letters and gospels in their preaching. We need one single canon to get everyone literally on the same page.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_10202;I hope they name the new Bible after me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_10203;When reforming a religion, it is important to get everyone on the same page, and that involves Church Councils. And while quite prestigious, these councils are normally called at the ruler's expense. And priests can be really expensive to pay for;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HRP_10203;I can't afford it right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_10204;When reforming a religion, you need to a way to train all your new priests in the proper dogma, and that requires schools. And someone has to pay these schools...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HRP_10204;I can't afford it right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_10205;Your Feudal Subjects have been quite supportive of your quest to formalize the Bogomilist faith, as they can see ways to profit off it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HRP_10210;The newest hot sect in Christendom is the Cathars, and they modeled a good amount of their faith off of yours, which does wonders for your attempts to formalize the Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HRP_10210;Excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_10220;Formalizing a religion is like herding cats, and rarely do those cats go where you want them. In this case a group of asetics have formed a monastery to retreat from the world, and they are having a negative effect on your attempts to centralize the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HRP_10222;Come at me, bro;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_10223;The more you formalize the faith, the more people are drawn to the power it represents. In this case, a number of less than savory fellows have entered the priesthood, using their positions to extract wealth from the people, who are understandably unhappy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HRP_10223;Pay for the losses yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HRP_10224;The Bogomilist tradition of Lay Preachers is still strong, despite your efforts to formalize the faith, and a number of them lately have been spreading, weakening all your attempted reforms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

These events have long simmered resentment amounst the Persian populance, finally breaking out into a nationalist revolt.

EVTDESC_HRP_19010;Babak, the leader of the Mazdakian rebellion has been captured.
