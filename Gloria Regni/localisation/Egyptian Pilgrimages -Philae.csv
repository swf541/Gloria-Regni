EVTNAME_PHI.10163;Pilgrimage to Philae;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10163;I have decided to go on a pilgrimage to visit the temple of Isis at Philae...;;;;;;;x
OPTPHI.10163;Off we go;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_PHI.10164;Departure;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10164;My things are packed and my escort is ready.;;;;;;;x
OPTPHI.10164;This should hopefully be spiritually rewarding;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10165;Good Arrival;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10165;You finally arrive; the Temple of Isis in Philae! You take your steps towards the Temple and feel yourself overcome with the presense of the Gods. ;;;;;;;;x
OPTPHI.10165;What a holy place!;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10166;Bad Arrival;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10166;You finally arrive; the Temple of Isis in Philae! You take your steps towards the Temple to enter, the Oracle waiting for you outside- but suddenly bickering ensues. You notice some Officers who had been accompanying you bickering!;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPTPHI.10166;Bad impressions...;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10167;Good Journey;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10167;The journey was well; the weather warm and with little bandit problems. On pilgrimages like these, why even bring escorts?;;;;;;;x
OPTPHI.10167;What a relaxing trip!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10168;Bad Journey;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10168;The journey was miserable. Your feet ache, it's cold and you were robbed on at least one occasion.;;;;;;;x
OPTPHI.10168;Next time, I'm bringing an army!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10169;Pilgrimage Bandits;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10169;On your way to the Temple, you decide to take a short break and stop for some rest. It doesn't take long before you find your camp attacked by bandits! Your men successfully fend them off, but they stole some goods...;;;;;;;;x
OPTAPHI.100169;Charge them!;;;;;;;;x
OPTBPHI.1000169;Send in my guards, I can not be bothered by this;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10170;Bandits Eliminated;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10170;The bandits are crushed and your goods retaken!;;;;;;;x
OPTPHI.10170;Wonderful;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10171;Bandits Escape;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10171;The bandits manage to escape you and your guards, this may not be a good omen for things to come.......;;;;;;;x
OPTPHI.10171;Damn bandits;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10172;Pilgrimage Oasis;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10172;After travelling without a source of water, you come upon a lake or oasis, should we stop and take a break?;;;;;;x
OPTAPHI.100172;No, we must hurry;;;;;;;;;x
OPTBPHI.1000172;It is time for a short break I suppose;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10173;Going into the Temple Chamber;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPHI.10173;You enter the Temple of Isis in Philae and proceed to make offerings to the Godess the same way in which she has been honored for generations;;;;;;;x
OPTAPHI.100173;Praise Isis;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEPHI.10177;Pilgrimage Beggar
EVTDESCPHI.10177;On your way to the Temple, a poor beggar comes by and asks if you could provide them with just a few coins so they could eat tonight...;;;;;x
OPTAPHI.100177;*Of course!;;;;;;;;x
OPTBPHI.1000178;Filthy peasant scum;;;;;;;;;x
