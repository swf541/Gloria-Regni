EVTDESCPA.10071;The city of Constantinople has finally fallen to our forces. Our ancestors have been fighting the Byzantines for centuries, but now the conflict is finally over.

EVTNAMEPA.10082;Reconquest of Dacia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10082;The former Roman province of Dacia has been brought back under Imperial control. The heavily forested kingdom was conquered by Emperor Trajan in 106 AD, who turned it into a Roman colony. Abandoned in 271 by Emperor Aurelian, the area became the home of various tribal peoples, such as the Gepids, Huns, and Avars, who frequently undertook raids across the Danube. With the reconquest of this fertile basin, Rome's Balkan provinces are now secure.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMEPA.10083;Conquest of Persia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10083;After centuries of warfare, Persia has finally been brought under Imperial control. The Persians were long-time rivals of Rome, and nearly caused it's downfall after the Roman-Sassanid wars of the 7th century. The Persian lands which were taken by Emperor Trajan were abandoned under his successor, Hardian, who seen them as indefensible, allowing the Parthians to recover them. With the conquest of Persia, Rome's rich eastern lands are now secure.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMEPA.10084;Conquest of Slavinia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10084;The slavic peoples around the Baltic have been brought under Imperial control.

Emperor Augustus had planned to push Rome's borders past the Elbe, but the setback at Teutoburg Forest forced the Romans back behind the Rhine. With the conquest of Slavinia, Emperor Augustus' dream has finally been realised.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPA.10086;The city of Tangiers has been recovered from the foreign barbarians at last. Known as Tingis in Roman times, the city was once the capial of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana. Lost to the Vandals in 425, the city was reconquered by Emperor Justinian in 534, but was lost again to the Arabs in 702. Although Tangiers' prime has long since ended, it should become an important city in the Empire once more.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPA.10090;The city of London has been recovered from the foreign barbarians at last. Known as Londinium in Roman times, the city was once the capital of the Roman province of Britannia.

Vicious rumours were spread about him after his death, mostly about his alleged alcoholism, but they were likely propaganda invented by his enemies.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPA.10111;The Normans have steadily advanced into southern Italy since their conquest of Aversa in 1029. An invasion of Capua in 1038 was followed by a war with Byzantium from 1041 to 1046, which seen the loss of Calabria. As a precursor to his planned conquest of Muslim Sicily, Duke Robert Guiscard laid siege to Bari and Brindisi in 1068. The Byzantine army was unable to defeat Robert, and Apulia fell into his hands in 1071, ending the Byzantine presence in Italy. With Byzantium engaged with the Seljuks in Armenia and Anatolia, you have the opportunity to invade Apulia.;;;;;;;;;x

You get dressed quickly and follow your advisor to the throne room, which is packed with courtiers. Before you can demand an explanation, one of your guards points to your throne. As you move towards your throne you notice a glowing feather lying in front of it, one of the symbols of the Peacock Angel.

EVTDESCPA.10172;The hot sun beams down upon you as your group makes it way towards Lalish. The nearest town is two days away, but you are nearly out of water. One of your men rides back suddenly and tells you he found an oasis just over the horizon. You could stop for water if you wish, but but it may delay your journey.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCPA.10173;You are riding towards Lalish when a man suddenly appears in the distance, startling you. Your guards draw their weapons and form a circle around you, ready to defend you if needed.

EVTDESCPA.10174;You order your guards to drop their weapons so the man may approach. They hesitate at first, but place them on the ground after you throw away your own dagger.

EVTDESCPA.10175;Your men spring into action, ready to strike the man down, but he suddenly vanishes.

EVTDESCPA.10179;Historically, the Magyars did not migrate to the Carpathian basin until 895, but with Bulgaria busy with the Byzantine Empire and Avar power weakening, it might be a good idea to invade Carpathia.

EVTDESCPA.10180;Although Hellenism has managed to regain enough of its power to become a true religion once more, its position is still precarious.
