BM_COMMUNE_OF_ROME_DESC;In 1143 the people of Rome rose up, and attempted to create a new Republic of Rome, called the Commune of Rome. They set up a senate and elected Giordano Pierloni as their patrician. It was at the height of the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, so the Commune sought the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor in their war against the Pope, whom they wanted to live as a priest. The rebels controlled much of the Roman countryside, and even destroyed the Pope's refuge of Tusculum. Pope Lucius II himself was killed during the assault. Eventually the Emperor turned against them, and re-installed the Pope, but for a brief moment, Rome was a republic once more.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAgladiators.3;Excellent;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.5;Sir here is your just due as my master.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAgladiators.5;Excellent;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.7;My lord, I humbly submit myself before you as a gladiator. I also humbly request that you provide me with the appropriate armour and weapons.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.7;Of Course;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgladiators.7;I cannot bear the expense;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.8;The reconstruction of the Colosseum has hit a serious snag. We don't know whether it was an accident of nature or sabotage, but much of our work has been undone. If we want to finish on schedule, then we'll have to go to considerable expense.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.8;Send the money.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCgladiators.9;Our advisers have informed us that they simply can't figure out how the Romans did it. It appears that much knowledge has been lost since the fall of the Empire, and we no longer have the know-how to build something like the Colosseum.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.9;Knowledge never leaves;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgladiators.9;Oh well;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.10;In ancient days, the Romans would use complex mechanisms to allow the Colosseum to be flooded, and naval battles would be fought within. It would be truly miraculous if we were to recreate this great feat, although there are no more battles upon the ocean as they existed.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.10;Let us commence construction.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgladiators.10;Battles on water? Don't make me laugh.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.11;The Colosseum is a great popular attraction, and is sure to draw many spectators. However it is up to us to determine how many can sit within, and how many will be forced to stand outside, straining to hear the exciting sounds.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCgladiators.12;The Colosseum was used as a refuge for all manner of dishonourable vagabond, and we are forced to expel them for our renovations. Now they have risen up in revolt, and drawn up into their cause thousands of the poor and dispossessed.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCgladiators.14;One of your gladiators has won a fight, and thus won you a sum of money. You could keep it, but the people would appreciate it if you distributed it amongst them.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCgladiators.16;One of your gladiators has lost a fight, and so his life. But more importantly he has lost you a substantial sum of money!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.16;Why me?;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.17;A merchant approaches you with three huge men in tow. He says that they're from the land Ethiopia, and fight more viciously than it is thought possible, and he is willing to sell you one for the Colosseum.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.17;Give me the cheapest on you have.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgladiators.17;I'll take that one in the middle.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCgladiators.18;One man is lying in the dust of the arena, his eyes wide and fearful. The other man is pointing a sword at his neck. They both look to you for instructions as to what to do next, will the man live, or die?;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEgladiators.19;The Gladiator Revolt;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.19;Gladiators from all over the empire have come together to fight against us. It started at a training school in the old city of Capua, and has since spread like wildfire across the entire nation. The gladiators demand equal treatment and a return home, and are willing to fight for it.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.19;Damn!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCgladiators.21;You are watching the gladiators train, when suddenly you are hit with the urge to go down to the ring and fight with them. It may be undignified and dangerous, but sometimes a man finds that he must prove himself to the world, whether he is an emperor or a gladiator.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.21;Let the fight commence!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgladiators.21;On second thought, never mind.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.22;The day's training has served you well. You left practically unscathed, and are now a much better fighter.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCgladiators.23;While excavating parts of the Colosseum, one team of labourers has come across a locked chest, undoubtedly hid by some frightened, long dead Roman nobleman shortly before the fall of the city. Inside there is a treasure trove of golden coins and other such valuable artefacts, all worth a pretty penny indeed.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.23;At least the Goths didn't get them...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.24;The foreman for the renovation of the Colosseum just entered the throne room. He says that while his men were working on the construction, they came across a cache of ancient Roman artefacts. There all sort of things in there, from swords and spears to chalices and paintings. Putting them on display in the throne room will really help our claim of being the inheritor of Rome.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.24;The swords will look wonderful over there...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgladiators.25;While the men were digging new foundations, they came across a small buried room. Upon entering, it became evident that it was a chapel. On the altar, there is a stack of ancient bibles, with beautiful drawings. They also contain previously unkonwn stories from the lives of the saints, some of them using first-hand sources! We should send them to the Pope as a gesture of goodwill.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgladiators.25;I'm sure he'll appreciate them.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
