EVTDESC_SSI_001;Odd looking strangers in exotic ships came ashore today, requesting an audience. They came bearing wondrous gifts and merchandise - stygian beads, pearls and colourful feathers. Their tongue was unknown to everyone at court, but it seemed they wanted land in exchange for their baubles!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_001;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SSI_002;Strangers from Beyond the Sea;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_002;There are rumours of exotic strangers in weird looking ships making landfall all along the Atlantic coast, speaking no known language, trying to buy land in exchange for obsidian beads, colourful feathers and gold. After refusing their offers, local rulers were apparently threatened with terrible curses and the might of a great emperor from beyond the Atlantic Ocean.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_002;Hah! A Fantasy Menace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_003;Thousands of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_SSI_004;Sunset Invasion;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_004;Thousands of exotic ships have arrived in [From.SeaZone.GetName], spewing out numberless hordes of ululating warriors in weird armor sporting feathers and bone. These invaders from beyond the sunset worship hellish demon gods, sacrificing the populations of entire towns on altars erected on top of pyramid shaped wooden edifices. They cut their victims' hearts out, carefully flay them, and let their devil priests wear the skins for many days...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SSI_006;Another huge fleet of the bloodthirsty Aztecs has been sighted in [From.SeaZone.GetName]. The populace is fleeing in fear of the charnel altars of the foreign demon gods. The dreadful lord of the invaders has allegedly taken a vow to conquer the whole world in the name of Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of the sun, and of war...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_SSI_030;News From Across the Sea;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_030;Rumours have reached Europe of a titanic struggle taking place across the Great Sea in the homeland of the Aztecs. The Aztecs themselves rarely discuss it with outsiders, but it appears they have been locked in a deadly war for some time with the Tawantinsuyu, a great empire from the mountains and jungles far to the south of Tenochtitlan. They are ruled by the Sapa Inca, who is allegedly the direct descendant of some kind of sun god.\n\nIf the stories are to be believed, the warriors of the Inca are armed with mysterious thunder-sticks capable of felling a man from great distance. The Aztec have only recently been able to halt their advance, in large part thanks to their mounted warriors riding horses imported from Europe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_030;Thunder-sticks? Sun gods? I have no time for this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SSI_031;The Fall of the Great Plains;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_031;The Aztec have come to terms with their fear of horses, and several breeders have been established in the valley of Anahuac in their homeland. There is precious little information from overseas, but from what can be pieced together it seems the Aztec have used their new cavalry regiments to great effect in finally pacifying their stubborn rivals on the northern plains.\n\nThe Shoshone Dominions and the Sioux Commonwealth have already been incorporated into their growing empire, and Aztec armies are now marching towards the last hold-outs of the Free Iroquis City-States on the Atlantic coast. It may only be a matter of time before the entire continent is ruled from the great imperial city of Tenochtitlan.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_031;The same must never happen here!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SSI_035;Delicacies From the Far West;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_035;War and disease are not the only things the Aztec have brought with them from Cemanahuac, their distant homeland. Their diet includes several strange plants that are supposedly edible, and many of these are now enjoyed as exotic delicacies in courts across Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAfter trading with Aztec merchants, enterprising farmers have sowed their fields with the seeds of a plant called potato, while others experiment with tomatoes and maize. Many nobles, however, have become enamored with a sweet drink called 'chocolate,' made of the beans of the cacoa tree.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_035;A passing fad. It will never catch on.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_040;All of Iceland is now a colony of the Aztec Empire. The Vikings who sailed to Vinland met natives who warned them of a powerful empire to the south, but those warnings went unheeded. Aztec nobles out of favour with the Emperor may henceforth be appointed governors of this cold and barren island.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_040;If only someone had listened...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_041;The cruel Aztec invaders are now fully in control of Ireland. Thousands of Irishmen have already been sacrificed in celebration, and their Aztec overlords are now in the process of constructing new temples and pyramids where future rituals to please their gods will no doubt take place.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_041;They must be thrown back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_042;The entirety of Britain, from the Scottish Highlands in the north to the White Cliffs of Dover in the south, has been incorporated into the great Aztec nation. This prosperous new colony will become the crown jewel of the Aztec colonial empire, and a springboard for future attacks against continental Europe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_042;Imperialist scum!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_043;The city of London has fallen under Aztec rule. Five virgins and fifty clergymen were sacrificed in celebration, and Aztec priests have already commanded the construction of a large ceremonial pyramid on the banks of the Thames.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_043;Disconcerting.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_044;The city of Paris has fallen under the cruel yoke of the Aztecs, and the Seine now runs red with the blood of the hundred unfortunate souls who were sacrificed to satisfy the demons masquerading as their gods. The Emperor himself has sent his accolades all the way from Tenochtitlan to the Aztec commanders involved.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_045;Aztec armies have reached Rome, and the city has been added to their empire. Terrible screams ring out from the Apostolic Palace as it is defiled by human sacrifice, while Aztec commanders touring the ancient Roman monuments lament the fact that they had no chance to prove themselves in battle against such a worthy foe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_046;The Imperial City of Constantinople has fallen to the Aztecs, and the great capital has left their warriors impressed, even though it can't compete with the splendor of Tenochtitlan. Aztec priests have already made preliminary plans for the demolishment of the Hagia Sophia, and the construction of a pyramid in its place.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_047;The city of Cordoba, sometimes referred to as the 'Jewel of the World,' has been seized by the Aztecs, who are not impressed. It compares poorly to the great imperial metropolises of the Valley of Mexico and the Yucatan, and the Aztecs sacrifice a hundred Cordoban citizens for their shameless impudence.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_048;The Aztecs have reached Cairo, and found the Great Pyramids of Giza to be unlike anything they have previously encountered. They surpass even the largest pyramids in Cemanahuac, and the Aztec High Priests have declared the surrounding area to be the holiest location outside of Tenochtitlan.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_060;The Aztec invaders have sacrificed [From.GetTitledName] to their demon gods! After bringing [From.GetHerHim] to one of their new temple pyramids, their wicked priests placed [From.GetFirstName] on an altar and sliced [From.GetHerHim] open with a ceremonial dagger. They then tore out [From.GetHerHis] still beating heart to the cheers of their assembled warriors.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_060;May [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] see [From.GetHerHim] safely to the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SSI_105;The Aztecs Meet With Defeat;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_105;The great Aztec warhost that crossed the ocean in their mad bid to conquer all of Creation has been thrown back into the sea. Their colonies have been lost and their armies vanquished. The pitiful remnants of their invasion force has set sail back towards their homeland of Cemanahuac to lick their wounds and inform the Aztec Emperor of their defeat.\n\nThere may come a time when their own shores are visited by fleets from the Old World, and when that happens the debt they have incurred with their former victims will no doubt be collected in full... with interest.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_105;There shall be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SSI_070;Aztecs Spread Disease;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_070;There is no end to the evils the Aztecs have inflicted upon this land. A strange disease emanating from their conquered territories has begun to spread throughout the Old World. The symptoms are similar to those of the dreaded Great Pox, but this cursed plague seems even more virulent. Men skilled in the art of medicine have dubbed it 'syphilis' and all attempts to treat it have thus far met with failure.\n\nNow even those beyond the reach of the Aztec armies are imperiled, as this disease, carried by refugees and merchants, sweeps across Europe and the Middle East like an unstoppable tidal wave.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SSI_070;We are being punished for our sins.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SSI_071;Smallpox Spreads Across the Sea;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SSI_071;It seems that plunder and slaves are not the only things the Aztec sailors have brought back with them to their own shores. Rumours have trickled back to the Old World telling stories of smallpox pandemics sweeping across the Aztec Empire and its neighbours.\n\nThe streets and alleys of Tenochtitlan are said to be littered with the dead and dying, and the Aztec Emperor has commanded the immediate execution of all slaves and prisoners captured on the Great Eastern Continent in an effort to stem the spread of the disease.;;;;;;;;;x
