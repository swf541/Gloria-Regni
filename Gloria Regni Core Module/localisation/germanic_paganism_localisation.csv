east_germanic_pagan_DESC;The East Germanic faith is that of the Goths and the other East Germanic peoples. The many far migrations of these tribes have given journeying and travelling a mystical importance, and the cultures along the way have also greatly shaped the faith. The main god Gapt, founding deity of the Gothic peoples, is accompanied in godhood by Teiws, the honourable god of war, and Frauja and Fráujo, the dual twin gods of fertility and nature. Apart from the many spirits, who inhabit rivers, forests, and fields, there are also some other important gods, such as Engus, Fairguneis, and the god of the Danube river Donaws.;;;;;;;;;;;x

norse_pagan_DESC;The Norse faith is a collection of beliefs and practices peculiar to the far north, almost parallel to the Germanic faith yet tempered by the harsh realities of life in distant Scandinavia. It is believed that there are two major godly families. The royal gods, the Æsir, are said to live in the palace of Ásgarðr on top of the world tree Yggdrasil, and they are led by the one-eyed god Óðinn, god of wisdom, his son Þórr, the Thunderer, and the one-armed Týr, the god of war. The other family, the Vanir, are gods of nature, and reside all over the world. Most trees, groves, and pools are said to hold Vanr spirits. This family's most prominent members are Njörðr, god of the sea, and his son and daughter Freyr and Freyja, dual gods of fertility.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;x
