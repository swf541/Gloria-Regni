EVTDESC_MCW_1;The common people in some of the provinces of our realm have always been undeniably foreign, but many of them are not so foreign as to be completely alien to us. As the years go on, a few these people have gradually adopted more and more of our ways, and with a little royal patronage they could perhaps become our own brethren...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_1;It shall be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_1;We must preserve our own distinctiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_3;Although our lands are good and our realm is full of splendour, some parts of our territory have long been inhabited by infidel barbarians, inveterate heathens who spurn honesty, truth and faith. Despite their ignorant ways, these people live on rich soil, soil which would better serve our own diligent and productive countrymen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_3;Open the land up to our settlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_3;It is important to stay clear of these heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_4;Our own people have a long and proud history, that much is certain. But compared to the imperial splendour of these foreign lands even we cannot help feeling somewhat inadequate. As a ruler, I find it a great challenge to govern over a nation with such strong and ancient traditions of their own, and I find that I rely more and more on native talent to staff my court. Perhaps it is time for our people to truly don the awe-inspiring mantle that has been left for us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_4;We must make ourselves the true heirs of these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_4;We will eclipse their glory in time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_5;I lead a busy life, but every few weeks I make sure to wander the teeming streets that hang like a garland of life and activity around the pinnacles and ramparts of my palace. As a foreigner in these lands I can't help but to feel something of a cringe as I compare my own uncouth accent with the refined tongue of the locals, and the wares sold by the merchants and artisans are certainly a notch above anything in our homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_5;I will teach myself to be more like these people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_5;The grass is always greener on the other side...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_6;Towns to tax, cities to maintain, clergy to appease, peasants to lord over: the multitude of skills need to rule over such an old and complex country as this can barely be overstated. Our people are simple and yearn for the simpler life back home, and our rather rustic ways make it difficult for us to earn the full respect of the locals. So far I've resisted the allure of falling into soft foreign ways, but is there really any point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_6;We cannot be mere bumpkins any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_6;Our pride brought us this far, why give in now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_7;After riding to power on horseback, emerging from the wastes to crush whole armies and win immense riches, we can surely count our people as the greatest conquerors in the world. Conquering from the saddle though, is the easy part. Ruling from the saddle is much more difficult, especially when our way of life is so vastly different from that of the locals. There are few of us, and many more of them, and even though they may appear to be wretched and barbaric their goods and produce are certainly refined. Every week I find myself employing more and more natives in your armies and in your palace. I eat from their utensils, dress in their clothes and even speak to them in their language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_7;We are no longer what we once were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_7;Let us never become soft!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_8;Settlers and colonists are streaming out from the wealthy urbanised heartlands of our realm, driving barbarian foreigners from their property or swamping them with sheer numbers alone. In one of our provinces, the settlers are now close to outnumbering the natives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_8;The light of civilisation spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_8;Keep the settlers under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_9;Free farmers, peddlers and townsfolk looking for opportunities to make new lives for themselves and their families are on the move across our realm, relocating into territory inhabited by foreign infidels. Continuously increasing in strength and numbers every year, in one of our provinces the settlers are coming close to outnumbering the natives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_9;Let us encourage these pioneers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_9;Let us discourage these beggars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_10;Our people have always been productive farmers, hunters and fishermen in their own lands, but with the opening up of new foreign territories to exploit they are experiencing greater prosperity than ever before. Whilst the townsfolk and others who live away from the land cling to their own traditions, the fields and valleys now resound with the songs of our countrymen. In one of our provinces, our people are close to outnumbering the natives and will soon make up the majority of the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_10;Let us all enjoy this new prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_10;The serfs belong on their turf!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_11;In the parts of our realm that were once home to barbarian heathens, a strange and chilling change has taken place. Roads have fallen into disrepair, ancient palaces are crumbling to dust and once-powerful cities are now little more than wildernesses of fields and bricks. Many of the old inhabitants have left, and the few who remain are little better off than beggars. Amidst the broken detritus of ages past, encampments, strongholds and even whole new cities are springing forth, the fledgling outposts of our own people. In one of our provinces, the newcomers are close to outnumbering the wretched natives, and will soon make up the majority of the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_11;The past fades away before us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_11;This urban decline cannot be a good thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_12;Along the coasts fishermen and traders from distant shores mingle freely, spreading their customs and traditions across the rolling waves. Sea-farers from our great capital pull into port wherever and whenever they need to rest their sea-legs on dry land, and some of them even find sweethearts or wives amongst the locals. In one of our provinces the influx of sailors has been so prolific that the once-foreign inhabitants appear to have largely adopted our own ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_12;It almost makes me want to travel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_12;These adulterers belong at home with their families.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MCW_13;The people of Scandinavia are truly at home on the waves, and have the courage to cross whole oceans in search of adventure. Across Scandinavia thousands of young men are leaving their homes and families to start new lives for themselves overseas, buying up homesteads or selling their wares in any place accessible by ship. In one of our provinces Scandinavians are now about to outnumber the foreigners who once called this land their own, and even the locals are starting to follow our ways and worship our own gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MCW_13;A true golden age!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MCW_13;Those men should be raiding, not trading!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
