EVTDESCFCR.98500;A blind Venetian,patrician by the name of Enrico Dandolo has arrived in your court. He has worked as,a bailus in Constantinople overseeing our small possessions there for many years,before being assigned as ambassador to the city of world's desire.

EVTDESCFCR.98501;The Crusader army, ready to do battle of behalf of God, is stranded in Venezia and is unable to pay for the ships they have commissioned from us.

EVTOPTAFCR.98501;Just get me that gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTBFCR.98501;You would raid other Christians for gold? This is sinful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTCFCR.98501;I am confident this will work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98502;Reports from the Adriatic indicate a Crusading army is being diverted to Constantinople. In typical fashion, the west has come to us for brief stay before moving to their target. It is possible they are in need of supplies but until they arrive, we have no idea what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTAFCR.98502;We welcome our Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTOPTBFCR.98503;Stall them until we have the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTCFCR.98503;I want them gone. We will pay in full immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTOPTAFCR.98507;What have I done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98508;The Crusaders have sacked the city and have declared a new successor state to Rome. They have crown Baudouin I as their new Emperor in Constantinople and denounce any who do not recognise his claim to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTNAMEFCR.98509;Sack of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98509;The city of world's desire has been sacked, looted, pillaged and seized by a Crusading army intended to take on the enemies of Christendom. The Crusaders, lead by Venetian patrician Enrico Dandolo, were stranded in Venice due to insufficient payments made to the Venetians after they provided them a fleet for transportation before being diverted to Constantinople. However, it would seem that Venetian ships come at a price for the Crusaders as they have occupied Constantinople after lengthy hand-to-hand fighting. As for the Byzantine Empire, it remains to be seen as to how the remnants of Rome in the east will proceed now that their mighty city has fallen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"EVTDESCFCR.98511;We have received an envoy from a Crusading army that requires transport overseas to assist with the current Crusade.

EVTOPTAFCR.98511;If God wills it then we will build this fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTBFCR.98511;We have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98512;The bulk of the Crusader army has arrived at Venezia. Whilst the army is not as large as were told, the number of ships needed to transport the men just within the city is still significant. This will impact our commerce for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTAFCR.98512;Those ships had better be built quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98513;Venice has rejected a Crusader army that is being prepared against the infidel. They are the only ones in a position to transport the army yet they refuse. Surely this is a sin against God?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTAFCR.98513;Excommunicate the city if they do not receive them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98514;The Pope has received word of our rejection of the Crusading army and is threating to excommunicate the whole city! He demands that Venice builds the ships that they require.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTOPTBFCR.98514;Who does the Pope think he is? I run Venice!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
"EVTDESCFCR.98515;The fleet is constructed and the Crusaders are preparing to board the vessels now but the short-term damage to our economy is done already. Finally, the agreement was 850 gold in exchange for the vessels and now is the time for the Crusaders to fulfill their end of the deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,
EVTOPTAFCR.98515;This has cost us a lot of money so they had better pay up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTOPTBFCR.98516;I knew helping those Crusaders was a bad idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98517;Enrico Dandolo assures us that he will not attack whole cities and will instead try to threaten gold out of nearby ports. He is adamant that this is the only way and states he will only focus on enemies of Venice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98517_RANDOM;The Crusaders agree to the idea and are already preparing to depart. They will raid coasts that are hostile to us and, if possible, force an enemy port to submit to us. We have placed several watchers on the vessels to oversee the adventure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTAFCR.98517;We cannot disband the Crusading army, allow Dandolo to proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTOPTBFCR.98519;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98520;Despite Dandolo's assurances that the Crusaders would only raid and threaten ports around the Adriatic Sea and only then enemies of Venice, the city of Zadar was besieged and taken by the army. Dandolo now claims the whole area around Zadar to be Venetian territory and has sent us the remaining gold we needed from the Crusaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98520_VENICE;Our watchers on the Crusader vessels have informed us that, despite instructions to only raid and take enemy ports when necessary, the city of Zadar was besieged and taken by the Crusader army.

EVTDESCFCR.98520_RANDOM;Our watchers on the Crusader vessels have informed us that, despite instructions to only raid and take enemy ports when necessary, the Crusaders have besieged the city of Bastia in Corsica and have now taken it.

EVTOPTAFCR.98520;An unexpected surprise but an excellent one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTBFCR.98520;This is not what was agreed too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTDESCFCR.98526;During the breakup of the Byzantine Empire, the islands of Cephalonia and Corfu were seized by Genoan pirates. However, the Venetians have expelled them and are now occupying the islands for themselves. They now control the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

EVTOPTBFCR.98526;That island belong to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTDESCFCR.98528;When the Crusaders sacked Constantinople, the islands of Cephalonia and Corfu were occupied by our men under the guise of being pirates.

EVTOPTAFCR.98528;Genoa's influence expands!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98529;The Crusaders are insistent on resupplying at Constantinople as they state that they have nowhere else to go in order to resupply the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTAFCR.98529;Brace yourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESCFCR.98530;We may have lost our great city, but that does not mean it will never be ours again. Constantinople will always be ours and we will reclaim it one day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
