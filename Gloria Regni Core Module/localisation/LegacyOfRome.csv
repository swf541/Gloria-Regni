born_in_the_purple_desc;This character is porphyrogennetos - literally "born in the purple." It is an honor bestowed only to children born of a ruling Basileus or Basilissa in the purple chamber of the Imperial Palace. Their claim to the throne was traditionally stronger than that of older siblings born before their parents reign.;;;;;;;;;x

This practice originated in Persia, and is a common Roman way of dealing with political rivals without outright killing them, as a blind [Root.GetManWoman] is of little threat to the throne.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMELoR.1;The Reconquest of Syria Palaestina;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.1;The whole of Syria Palaestina has finally been liberated from the vile clutches of barbarians and restored to the Roman Empire. A great triumph will be held for the brave heroes who accomplished this feat. May their names echo in eternity!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.1;Long live the Empire!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.2;The Reconquest of Aegyptus;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.2;The dark times are over for the people of Aegyptus, as Roman rule has been restored to the land once more. The Land of the Pharaohs served well as the breadbasket of the old empire, and it will again become a vital cornerstone in the continued prosperity of the glorious Roman State.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.3;The Reconquest of Cyrenaica;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.3;The citizens of Cyrenaica can rejoice, as Roman law is once more upheld in this barren land. Yet another ancient Roman province has been returned to the bosom of the mightiest empire the civilised world has ever seen. May it never suffer the cruel touch of barbarians again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.4;The Recoquest of Africa;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.4;The influence of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is now felt throughout the former Roman province of Africa, as it once more falls under the sway of the Empire. Imperial troops are marching through the city of Carthage, the ancient nemesis of Rome, in definite proof that history does indeed repeat itself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.5;The Reconquest of Illyricum;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.5;The former Roman province of Illyricum has again been restored to its rightful owners in the resurgent Roman Empire. With the eastern shores of the Adriatic secured, this important recruiting ground may prove vital in future campaigns to reclaim Rome's proper borders in the west.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.6;The Reconquest of Italia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.6;For the second time since the fall of the Western Empire, Italy has been liberated and restored to proper Roman rule - hopefully for good this time. The great city of Rome itself is now yours, and even hardened soldiers can be seen weeping as the Imperial standard flutters in the breeze from Trajan's Column.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.7;The Reconquest of Gallia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.7;Gaul, long thought forever lost to Roman rule, has submitted to the [Root.GetTitle] and been incorporated back into the Empire. The region has changed much since Caesar campaigned in it over a thousand years ago, but no longer will it suffer under the rule of upstart kings or false emperors.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.8;The Conquest of Germania;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.8;The Roman Empire has now expanded beyond the borders it claimed even under the great Trajan. Germania, ever the bane of Roman armies, has at long last been pacified and incorporated into the Empire. It will now be ruled by the true continuation of the Roman State - not a false empire pretending at such.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.9;The Reconquest of Britannia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.9;Cruelly left to their own devices when the Roman garrisons abandoned the province of Britannia in the 5th century, the Bretons can at last rejoice. For after suffering through centuries of darkness, Roman rule has finally been restored to their little island and they may consider themselves Imperial subjects once more.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.10;The Reconquest of Hispania;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.10;The power and influence of the Roman Empire now extends all the way to the old province of Hispania once more. This land has suffered greatly from the constant border skirmishes waged by its bickering Muslim and Catholic lords, but now it may finally know peace again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.11;The Reconquest of Mauretania;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.11;The great general Belisarius reconquered parts of Mauretania from the barbaric Vandals in the 6th century, but it was all eventually lost to the Arabs in their relentless drive across North Africa. Now that this land has been fully restored to Roman control after centuries of misrule, it may flourish again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.12;The Reconquest of Mesopotamia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.12;Emperor Trajan conquered Mesopotamia from the Parthian Empire and organized it as a Roman province, but it was abandoned by his successor Hadrian just a few years later. Now the Euphrates and Tigris rivers are once again under the Roman aegis, and this time they may be there to stay.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.13;The Conquest of Caledonia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.13;The borders of Rome have now advanced well beyond the ancient ruins of both Hadrian's Wall and the Antonine Wall to at last include all of Caledonia. This hard and unforgiving land is the home of a peculiar breed of people, but they will be turned into productive Roman citizens yet.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.14;The Conquest of Hibernia;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.14;The island of Hibernia is the latest addition to the ever-expanding domains of the Roman Empire. This land of gently rolling hills and green fields was never conquered by the old empire, but it should become a pleasant fief to govern if one does not mind the rain or the foul-smelling Norse settlers along the coast.;;;;;;;;;x

restore_roman_empire_desc;If Rome and other key territories of the old empire could be reclaimed, the Byzantine Empire would win recognition in the eyes of the West as the true and rightful continuation of the Roman State.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.20;The Roman Empire is restored.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.20;The Dawn of a New Era;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.20;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears! After the miraculous recovery of territory lost centuries ago, the Roman Empire has been reborn! Europe has endured dark times since the imperial frontiers were stormed by barbarians and province after province burned at their touch, but now a bright new age has dawned for all of civilization.\n\nThe Roman State will no longer be referred to as the "Empire of the Greeks" by jealous pretenders in the West, but recognized as the true heir to the legacy of Rome. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] rules a restored Roman Empire, but much work remains to be done. There is still territory to recover and ancient borders to reclaim.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.20;Long live the Empire!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.21;The Second Age of Rome;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.21;The Byzantines, previously referred to as the "Empire of the Greeks" by many in the West, have somehow managed to reclaim enough lost territory to declare the Roman Empire restored! It can no longer be denied that they are the true successors of Rome and its glorious legacy. They claim a new era is upon us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.21;Can it be true?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.21;But... what about my empire?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.30;In honor of the Empire's recent victory, it would be appropriate to hold a triumph in the capital for the heroic soldiers who fought in the campaign. Such an arrangement will be expensive, but the people expect nothing less.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.30;Yes, a glorious triumph will be held.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.30;A brief ovation at the Hippodrome should be enough.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCLoR.30;No, we have no time for such nonsense.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.31;A triumph is held at the Hippodrome.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.31;A mighty triumph is held at the Hippodrome to celebrate the brave generals and soldiers who brought defeat to the enemies of the Empire. The people cheer as trumpeters lead a long procession that includes parading soldiers, carts filled with the spoils of war and cages holding captives from the recent campaign.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.31;The Empire is on the verge of success.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.32;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle] has commanded that a triumph be held at the Hippodrome to celebrate the brave soldiers responsible for the Empire's recent victory. The people cheer as trumpeters lead a long procession that includes parading soldiers, carts filled with the spoils of war and cages holding captives from the recent campaign.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.32;An impressive display.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMELoR.40;The Imperial Borders Are Restored;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.40;The story of the Roman Empire's glorious recovery will be told throughout the ages. Those unfortunate enough to have lived through the black days when barbarians sacked Rome at will or the Arab invaders swept in from the desert would not have dared dream of this day. All of the old provinces have been reclaimed and the Empire now stretches farther than it has in nearly a thousand years.\n\nChurch bells across Europe are ringing to celebrate this momentous occasion and men and women in both Rome and Constantinople are weeping tears of joy. It will be a challenge to keep an empire of this scale together, but for the sake of all humanity you must succeed, lest the world plunge into yet another dark age of ignorance and barbarity bereft of Rome's guiding light.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.40;The Empire will not fall again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.200;With the city back under East Roman control, the Patriarchate of Antioch has been properly restored as one of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was originally founded by Saint Peter the Apostle, who is regarded as the first Pope by the Western Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.200;God be praised!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.201;With the city back under East Roman control, the Patriarchate of Jerusalem has been properly restored as one of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was originally founded by Saint James the Just, who was made head of the Church in Jerusalem soon after the death of Jesus.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.202;With the city back under East Roman control, the Patriarchate of Alexandria has been properly restored as one of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was originally founded by Saint Mark the Evangelist, who became Alexandria's first patriarch.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.203;With the city back under East Roman control, the Patriarchate of Rome has been properly restored as one of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. If all five historical patriarchates are returned to the Pentarchy, the Great Schism between the Eastern and Western churches may finally be mended.;;;;;;;;;x 
mend_great_schism;Mend the Great Schism;;;;;;;;;x 
mend_great_schism_desc;The Great Schism saw the Christian Church divided into two branches, but if all five of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy could be restored under Roman rule and the Orthodox faith, there may be a chance to finally reunite Christendom.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.210;The Great Schism is mended and Christendom reunited.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.210;The Great Schism Mended;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.210;At last the Great Schism between the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church has been mended. With the spread of Orthodoxy and the reunification of the Pentarchy, including the vital episcopal see of Rome, the Catholic faith now holds little sway over the people of Europe. There will be those who still cling to it, but they will be few in number and the Pentarchy can once more claim universal rule over all of Christendom.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.211;If that's the way the wind is blowing...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.211;I will never give up my faith!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.400;An Innocent Proposal;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.400;One day in the Imperial Palace, while surrounded by shouting advisors waving decrees and edicts that demand your signature, a small man approaches claiming to be a representative of the Venetoi - the "Blues," one of the two major chariot teams racing in Constantinople. They no longer have the political influence they enjoyed in the days of Justinian the Great, but they are still popular with the broad masses. You wave your advisors away and decide to hear him out.\n\nThe man introduces himself as Anaximandros and explains that he has a proposal for you. If you race for the Blues in the grand chariot race next week, he and his associates will make certain you win. You both stand to gain from this, with the glorious [Root.GetTitle] winning as a champion of the great Blue team.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.400;An intriguing proposal... count me in.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.400;By cheating? No thanks.;;;;;;;;;x 
hippodrome_refuse;You refuse to take part in this scheme.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.401;You practise chariot racing.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.401;Practise Makes Perfect;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.401;You practise hard at chariot racing to better prepare for the upcoming event at the Hippodrome. Despite managing well enough and only falling off the chariot a handful of times, you simply cannot see how you are supposed to beat the other professional racers. When you mention this to Anaximandros, the little gnome of a man smiles and tells you not to worry. He assures you that the Greens, your main opponents, will not be a problem, and the other Blue racers have been instructed to let you win.\n\n"You had better be right about this," you tell Anaximandros. "If I am made to look the fool, I swear I will not be the only one to suffer.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.401;Let us get this over with.;;;;;;;;;x 
hippodrome_tooltip;To the Hippodrome!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.402;The Day of the Race;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.402;It is a fine day for racing and the Hippodrome is packed with people wanting to see their [Root.GetTitle] conquer... or fail miserably in the attempt. Spyridon, the star of the Greens, looks at you with scorn as your chariots line up. "I shall endeavour not to embarrass you too much, Your Imperial Majesty," he says through clenched teeth.\n\nThe trumpets blow, and the race begins! One by one, the Green chariots fall apart and topple over, giving you a clear path. Only Spyridon's armored chariot remains of the Green team, but as your Blue allies move to block him, their chariots disintegrate as well. It seems both teams had the same idea. Still, you skillfully navigate through the wreckage and manage to hold off Spyridon long enough to win the race!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.402;Victory, but not thanks to Anaximandros!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.403;The Day of the Race;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.403;It is a fine day for racing and the Hippodrome is packed with people wanting to see their [Root.GetTitle] conquer... or fail miserably in the attempt.

Only Spyridon's armored chariot remains of the Green team, but as your Blue allies move to block him, their chariots disintegrate as well. It seems both teams had the same idea. Without their aid, Spyridon steers his chariot past you and wins the race!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.403;Defeat! Anaximandros will pay!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.404;The Day of the Race;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.404;It is a fine day for racing and the Hippodrome is packed with people wanting to see their [Root.GetTitle] conquer... or fail miserably in the attempt.

The furious crowds storm the arena in disgust at this blatant attempt by both teams to cheat!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.404;Back! Back, I say!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.405;The chariot race has concluded.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.405;Another Proposal...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.405;As you walk at a brisk pace through an empty corridor in the Imperial Palace, on your way to another tiring meeting with your advisors, you hear a faint whisper from one of the window curtains. After readying your dagger you pull the curtains aside to reveal Anaximandros, the gnome-man who recruited you into chariot racing!\n\n"You! I should have you drawn and quartered," you hiss at the man. "The entire Blue team had their chariots fall out from under them!" Anaximandros smiles at you, and speaks: "Calm yourself, Majesty. Your chariot held together, did it not? I have a new and cunning plan for the next race - one that cannot fail. Your epic victory will be celebrated for centuries to come.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.405;I may regret this, but I will join this scheme.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.405;Not interested. Guards, haul this wretched creature away!;;;;;;;;;x 
hippodrome_refuse_second;Anaximandros is thrown into the dungeons and you put this vile scheme behind you for good.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.406;You resume your training.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.406;Training Resumes;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.406;You resume your chariot training and although you are an even better racer now, it still may not be enough to best the other competitors, many of whom have been driving chariots since early childhood. Anaximandros approaches to tell you of his new scheme.\n\n"Behold, Majesty," he says, and produces a small bottle from within his cloak. "One drop of this concoction, which my associates and I only acquired at great cost I might add, is enough to send a man running for the latrines within minutes. Each member of the Green team will be offered some spiced wine by their quartermaster - a man in our employ - just before the race is about to begin. I think you can see where I am going with this, Your Grace...";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.406;Good. This might actually work!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.407;The Day of the Second Race;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.407;Once again you ride into the Hippodrome in your chariot to the cheers of the people. It looks like nearly all of Constantinople has turned up for this momentous race. Spyridon, your old nemesis, is instructing the rest of the Green team when their quartermaster offers them a sip of wine to fortify their resolve. All accept this offer, except Spyridon. Instead, he loudly proclaims, he will offer his wine to the Blue team who need it more. Before you can object, the other Blue racers happily share the wine between them...\n\nThe trumpets blare and the race begins. Within seconds the first few racers leap off their chariots, sprinting for the latrines. Soon only you and Spyridon remain. Fortune favours you, however, as Spyridon collides with the last racer to abandon his chariot. This delays him enough to grant you victory!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.407;Victory, but no thanks to Anaximandros!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.408;The Day of the Second Race;;;;;;;;;x

He overtakes you in the final lap and rides his chariot to victory.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMELoR.409;The Day of the Second Race;;;;;;;;;x

It is obvious to all that foul play is involved. They jump into the arena!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.409;Back, knaves!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.410;One Sunny Afternoon...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.410;You enjoy a quiet moment away from your advisors under the shade of a tree in the palatial garden. A sound from above catches your attention, and as you look up you spot Anaximandros, the chariot gnome, hiding on a branch. "Your Grace," he whispers with a smile. "Before I suffer your wrath, I ask that you hear me out."\n\nHe scurries down from the tree and gives you his new offer. "Fate may have conspired against us in the past, Majesty, but this time my plan is foolproof." He flashes a toothless grin, the closest he can manage to a winning smile. "Third time's the charm, eh, Your Majesty? What do you say?";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.410;It had better be. I am in.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.410;You must be joking. Guards!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.411;The Chariot;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.411;Anaximandros brings you to a small workshop in one of the seedier districts of Constantinople. Here, he explains, they will weaponize your chariot. While you watch, the craftsmen install a pair of extendable metal blades into its chassis, intended to shred the wheels of any chariot adjacent to yours.\n\nYou train extensively with the new chariot until you have mastered its new weapons. As you are about to leave for the Hippodrome on the eve of the race, Anaximandros hands you a flanged mace. "For good measure," he explains.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.411;Let us hope it does not come to that.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.412;The Day of the Third Race;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.412;This is it, the final race of the season. The Hippodrome is filled to capacity and a deafening roar greets you as you ride your chariot into the arena. You line up next to Spyridon, your old foe from the Greens and the crowd's favorite. "Your Majesty," he says and spits on the ground.\n\nThe trumpets blow and the race begins, but it seems you weren't the only one to have brought arms. Everything turns into a huge melee as all the drivers hack and slash at each other using both handheld and chariot-mounted weaponry. Anaximandros has played both sides against each other - there can be no other explanation. The situation escalates further when the agitated crowds enter the fray. You spot Anaximandros climbing into Spyridon's chariot, and the two of them escape the Hippodrome through the unguarded exit.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.412;Give chase!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.412;Stay behind.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.413;You remain at the Hippodrome to stifle this riot.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.413;Aftermath;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.413;As Spyridon and the traitor Anaximandros depart the Hippodrome leaving nothing but chaos in their wake, you rally the Varangian Guard to your side. Together with a squadron of cataphracts from the nearby garrison you finally manage to bring order to the madness. The cost of life is great, especially amongst the audience, but it can't be helped.\n\nYour career as a chariot racer is over, but despite everything, you have emerged through all this as the strongwilled leader many feel the Empire needs. You wonder what possible motive compelled Anaximandros to turn the Blue and Green factions against each other in open battle. For how long did he mastermind events with that purpose in mind? You will likely never know. He is now a wanted man throughout the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.413;Bloody gnome.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.414;You pursue them outside the Hippodrome.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.414;The Chase Is On;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.414;You leave the madness of the Hippodrome behind and steer your chariot out into the streets of Constantinople, in hot pursuit of Spyridon and the traitor Anaximandros. With blades unfolded, your chariot smashes through market stalls and pottery in the narrow back alleys while a hissing Anaximandros tries to give you a taste of the whip, without success.\n\nYou rush past the Hagia Sophia and onto the Augustaion square as terrified priests scramble to get out of the way. With a sharp turn you continue forward on the Mese, the main thoroughfare, and speed past oxcarts and the Forum of Constantine before Spyridon abruptly turns north, towards the Golden Horn. He finally loses control of his chariot at the docks, and it crashes into some stacked crates. You step out of your chariot and draw your mace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.414;Give no quarter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.414;Show mercy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.416;You show mercy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.415;No Quarter Given;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.415;Spyridon has been impaled on a nearby fence and his dead eyes glare at you accusingly. Anaximandros, however, lies wheezing on the docks with a broken leg. He curses your name as you approach him with your mace. "Why do all this?" you ask him. "What could you possibly gain?"\n\nThe little man grins wryly at you. "Eons ago, there were four chariot racing teams: the Blues, the Greens, the Whites and the Reds. Then the two most powerful teams all but absorbed the two weakest. Who speaks of the Whites today? Or the Reds? Where is their glory? The domination of the Blues and Greens had to end, Majesty. At any cost. If my nephew Spyridon and I could get them to wipe each other out..." You have heard enough. With a single blow, your mace forever silences Anaximandros.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.415;One less headache for me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.415;You show no mercy.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR.417;Members of the Varangian Guard leap into the arena in defense of their [Root.GetTitle] and swiftly cut down those rioters foolish enough to approach your chariot. They rush you to the safety of your palace, but the rest of Constantinople burns when the upset crowds spill out of the Hippodrome and onto the streets. As you watch the fires spread from your palatial balcony, you raise your fists to the heavens and bellow at the top of your lungs:\n\n"AAANNNNAAAXIMANDROOOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.417;When I get my hands on him...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.500;Chariot races are scheduled to be held soon at the Hippodrome. Eight charioteers from the traditional Blue and Green teams will be competing for glory on the track. You may choose to throw your weight behind one of these factions and bet on them in a show of support.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR.831;Your jailors enter your cell grinning from ear to ear - something experience has taught you is a very bad sign. "Good news!" one of them says cheerfully.

EVTDESCLoR.833;The commotion outside your cell wakes you suddenly and you demand to know what is going on.

EVTOPTALoR.833;No! NO!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTALoR.834;These are violent times.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.840;Supporters of the Blue and Green chariot teams have clashed at the Hippodrome and riots have broken out! The City Guard is fighting to contain the situation, but the Varangian Guard is also standing by. They would make mincemeat of any hooligans before the riot has a chance of spreading to other districts, but there could be significant collateral damage...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPLoR.841;The Varangians prepare for battle.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.841;Hundreds of rioting chariot supporters are hacked down as the axe-wielding Norsemen charge into their ranks. Many attempt to flee, but the Varangians give chase and show no mercy to those they catch. The streets are littered with the mangled corpses of hooligans... and a few dozen innocent bystanders. The Varangians are a blunt hammer to be wielded with care.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.841;Such is the fate of those who oppose me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.842;The City Guard rallies.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.842;The City Guard pulls in reinforcement from the other districts and finally manage to disperse the rioting crowds. Many neighborhoods are burning and looting is widespread in those districts the Guard was forced to abandon, but the loss of life is relatively small.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.842;Centuries from now, hooliganism will be extinct.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.846;[From.GetFirstName], your impudent daughter, seems to have fallen head over heels in love with one of your Varangian bodyguards, and the feeling is mutual. She has asked your permission to marry the man. He is apparently considered to be of some minor nobility in the frozen North, but can hardly be considered "good stock.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.846;Very well. Whatever makes her happy.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCLoR.846;Have the Varangian executed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.851;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sends word that several members of the Varangian Guard ran amok in his quarter of Constantinople yesterday. In their drunken stupor, the Norsemen set fire to an inn, killed three guards and physically abused five local merchants and two priests. The people are crying out for justice.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.851;Make an example of them.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMELoR.860;Meanwhile at the Imperial Palace...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.860;You are enjoying a late supper at the Great Palace in Constantinople, sampling some new wines brought in from the provinces, when the sound of a distant explosion is heard. Windows shatter and the chandelier above begins to sway as the shockwave hits a second later. Dust trickles down from the roof, and to your dismay some of it lands in your wine.\n\nYou hurry to a balcony overlooking the city and see an intense fire burning at one of the warehouses by the docks. The nearby water in the Golden Horn is also ablaze, and the fire has already spread to several ships in the busy inlet. While their crews are in the process of abandoning them, the harbor area is rocked by a flurry of smaller explosions from the burning warehouse.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.860;This must be investigated!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBLoR.860;Pretty, but I need a new glass of wine.;;;;;;;;;x 
not_interested_in_explosion;You forget all about this explosion and drink some more wine.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.861;You open an investigation into this strange explosion.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.861;Sifting Through the Ashes;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.861;The next day, after the fire has finally burned out, you inspect the ruins of the warehouse with your bodyguard. You learn from your advisors that this building housed the primary stockpile of liquid fire, or "Greek fire" as it is commonly referred to as outside the Empire. This slow-burning liquid can set water itself aflame and has delivered Constantinople safely from more than one siege.\n\nThe damage done to the warehouse and harbor area is the least of your concerns, however. No trace remains of the liquid's formula, a closely guarded Byzantine state secret since the 7th century, or the alchemists who were working in the warehouse. Without them or the formula, your supply of liquid fire has been cut off.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.861;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.862;You return to the palace...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.862;Pirates sighted!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.862;Strange reports have surfaced of a pirate fleet in the Black Sea. If witnesses are to be believed, the pirates burn those who will not surrender with a "sea fire" spewed forth from the prows of their galleys. Could it be that these pirates have somehow obtained the formula for liquid fire?\n\nIf this critical weapon enters widespread use by the enemies of the Empire, we will lose a decisive edge! The Megas Doux has drawn up a plan to dispatch a small naval task force to the Black Sea, which will seek out and capture these brigands. Your Spymaster has suggested an alternate plan, however. Spies will be planted in every major port around the whole sea until they manage to infiltrate the pirate gang and uncover their secret hideout.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMELoR.863;Battle off the Crimean coast!;;;;;;;;;x

In a hard-fought battle near the Crimea, your sailors managed to board and capture one of the pirate galleys. They lost several of their own ships to liquid fire in the attempt, but their prize is even now coming in to dock at the harbor in Constantinople.\n\nAmong the captured pirates is a young woman named Despina. This vixen was apparently the galley's captain, and she claims to be the daughter of the pirate king himself, a man named Kyrillos. If this is true, you may have gained a hostage worth her weight in gold...;;;;;;;;;x

In a hard-fought battle near the Crimea, the pirates ambushed your sailors and set their ships alight with liquid fire. A single ship escaped and has just now managed to limp back into port in Constantinople.\n\nIt is now clearer than ever that this potent weapon cannot be permitted to remain in the hands of savages and criminals. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTALoR.865;Yes... but what?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMELoR.866;Word from your spies!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCLoR.866;News have arrived from the Black Sea! One of your spies succeeded in infiltrating the pirate fleet, and has spent the past month as an oarsman on one of their galleys.

He brought a prisoner with him when he escaped from their fleet: a young woman named Despina. This vixen was apparently the captain of the galley he served on, and she claims to be the daughter of the pirate king himself, a man named Kyrillos.
