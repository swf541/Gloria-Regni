EVTDESC86000;You have started to prepare yourself for going on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Soon you will humble yourself and travel in a group with others to fulfill one of the five pillars of Islam.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86000;All are equal in front of God!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86001;I am preparing myself for my travel to Mecca, and I have understood that there are members of my court that have not yet gone on a pilgrimage to Mecca. As [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], it is my duty to be charitable to my people, and I will bring one of them with me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86001;It will make travel more enjoyable...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86001;It is too costly...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86010;While preparing for my pilgrimage to Mecca, I have come to realize that [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] is not a Hajjaj.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86010;Berate him about it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP86011;will listen to us...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86010;Clearly, he is a busy man...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86011;My beloved [Root.GetTitle]!\n I am preparing to go to Mecca on a Hajj. Sadly, rumors tell me that you have not gone on a pilgrimage yourself. Would you like to travel with me, your faithful servant?\nYour humble [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86011;I will prepare myself immediately!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP86012;will be travelling together with us...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86011;I am too busy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP86013;will be disappointed in me;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86012;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName]!\nI will join you on your way to Mecca!\nYour liege, [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86012;Allah is Great!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86013;I am sincerely regretful to inform you that I am not able to join you in your pilgrimage.\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86013;Allah will judge him...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86015;Our liege, [Root.Liege.GetTitledName], has heard of our plans to go to Mecca, and sends us advice that the road is perilous with infidels and bandits.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86015;Bring guards with you;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86015;Travel lightly;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86020;While preparing for my pilgrimage to Mecca, my son comes to me and asks if he can join me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86020;Bring him along;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86020;It would be too costly;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86100;I am now fully prepared for my travel to Mecca! There will be a regent ruling [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] while I am away.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86100;Onwards to Mecca!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86101;A group of bandits are tracking us, and it seems as if they are gaining on us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86101;Attempt to avoid them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86101;Its our duty to stop them..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP86102;Me and my group of pilgrims will engage the bandits.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86102;It is not possible to outrun these bandits, and we are forced to confront them. There is always the possibility that we can survive this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86102;They are few enough to defeat alone..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86102;Charge!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC86102;Pay them with our remaining gold.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86105;Travelling by sea causes you to feel seasick. Luckily there is a hafiz on the ship who quotes the holy Qur'an. 'And they shall be made to drink therein a cup the admixture of which shall be ginger'.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86105;I feel good!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86110;As you travel over the sea, your ship spots the sails of a well-known Christian pirate. We have a faster ship, and the chance to eliminate this threat to pilgrims forever!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86110;It's too great of a risk...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86110;We must stop these infidels!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86150;Nearby you see how a group of bandits have encircled a group of fellow pilgrims. It is very likely they will rob and kill them.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86150;There is nothing we can do...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86150;Attempt to rescue them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86151;We got surrounded by bandits, and I was sure that I was soon going to be robbed and left for dead, when some fellow pilgrims arrived to save us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86151;My brother!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86160;One of my servants have noticed that a hated rival is camping not far from us. I know that it is against the teachings of the prophet to attack someone on Hajj, but this is a golden opportunity.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86160;Attempt to ambush him in the night..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP86161;will face our steel!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86160;Befriend him...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP86165;will hear our invitation.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC86160;I'll just ignore him.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86161;We have been ambushed, and it seems as if it is [From.GetTitledName] who is attempting to kill you. It is an outrage, and it clear that he is not a proper Muslim to attempt such a vile act in the darkness!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86161;Fight back!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP86162;is left for dead in the night..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86161;Fight back!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC86161;We got enough time to run away..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86162;Our ambush ended in disaster... Not only did [From.GetTitledName] get away, but he also injured me severely.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86162;[From.GetTitledName] got the best of me..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86163;Success!\nI've left [From.GetTitledName], bleeding severely, to die in the desert...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86163;He will surely die soon enough..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86164;It seems that [From.GetTitledName] got away in the quiet of the night...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86164;It can't be helped...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86165;A messenger comes with an invitation from [From.GetTitledName] who is camped not far from us, offering to break bread and reconcile our differences.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86165;We are brothers in the faith after all..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86165;Politely Decline...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86166;[From.GetTitledName] has joined our camp and we are breaking bread together, reconciling our differences.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86166;Subhan'Allah;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86167;Honorable [Root.GetTitledName]!\nI regret to inform you that I will not be able to break bread with you today, as I need to break camp immediately.\n\n[From.GetTitledName] ;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86167;We have lost face!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86170;Travelling to Mecca gives time for reflection. A man should not go into excess when it comes to food, and should always abstain from wine!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86170;I shall be more moderate in my eating..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86170;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86180;It seems as if we have managed to get lost here in the desert. One of the humble servants seems as if he might know the right way.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86180;I am [Root.GetTitle]! I know the best way!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86180;Listen to the servant...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86300;As you stop for camp one evening, you notice that an old man in poor clothing has made camp at the same place. The man offers to tell you a hadith he has if you can spare him some bread.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86300;Listen to the old man;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86300;It is just an old man...;;;;;;;;;x 
TOOLTIP_LISTEN_TO_HADITH;You listen carefully to the old man's hadith.\n;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86320;The old man starts telling you, that Ka'b ibn Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Two hungry wolves loose among sheep do not cause as much damage as that caused to a man's deen by his greed for money and reputation.' ;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86320;Greed is against Islam!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86320;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86330;The old man says that, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would often pray, 'O Allah! I seek your protection from anxiety and grief, from incapacity and laziness, from stinginess and cowardice, and from the burden of debt and the domination of people.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86330;I bow my head and say the same prayer.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86330;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86340;The old man says that, Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Beware of envy. Envy devours good actions as fire devours wood.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86340;Envy harms myself!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86340;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86350;The old man says that, Ibn Mas'ud reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Truthfulness leads to piety and piety leads to the Garden. A man should be truthful until he is written down as truthful in the sight of Allah. Lying leads to deviance and deviance leads to the Fire. A person lies to the point that he is written down as a liar in the sight of Allah.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86350;I should be with the truthful!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86350;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86360;The old man quotes the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from Sunan Abu Dawood, "The most evil traits in a man are severe stinginess and uninhibited cowardice!";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86360;And I am no evil man...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86360;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86380;The old man starts telling you, that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq said.. "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'If people see an unjust person, and do not restrain him, Allah is very likely to seize them with retribution from Him.'";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86380;Allah commands to justice and doing good!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86380;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86390;The old man says, "As the holy Qur'an says, 'You desire the attractions of this world, but Allah desires the next world for you!', and 'Yes, you prefer the life of this world, but the next world is better and more lasting.'";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86390;This is wisdom!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86390;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86400;The old man says, As related by Al-Tirmidhi, "I said, O Prophet of Allah, will we be held accountable for what we say? He said, 'May your mother be bereft of you! Is there anything that topples people on their faces into the hellfire other than the jests of their tongues?'";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86400;I will think more on what I say...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86400;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86410;The old man says that Abu Hurairah heard the prophet say "When Allah decreed the Creation He pledged Himself by writing in His book which is laid down with Him: 'My mercy prevails over My wrath'.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86410;This is wisdom I was not aware of.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86410;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86510;As you arrive in Mecca you start preparing for the evening's prayer when you discover that the water in the well is not entirely pure. This would not be valid water to use for ablution.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86510;Inform others nearby.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP86511;will be grateful;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86511;While performing wudu before the night's prayer, a fellow pilgrim points out an impurity in the water!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86511;Cleanliness is half of faith!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86520;As you arrive in Mecca, you change from your travelling clothes and dress in the white ihram clothing. This cloth is intended to make everyone appear the same, as in the eyes of Allah there is no difference between a [Root.GetTitle] and a pauper!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86520;I am humbled....;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86550;You are now at Kabah itself, and performing the Tawaf. Seven circuits you will walk around the black stone, and each time you complete a circuit you point to the stone and say 'In the name of Allah, Allah is Great, Allah is Great, Allah is Great and praise be to Allah'.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86550;Shout at every circuit!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86550;Only shout the first three times;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86600;Performing the Sa'i involved running seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah. This is done to remember the search for water by Ishmael's mother...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86600;I feel invigorated!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86610;The ninth day in Mecca you perform the Wuquf at Mount Arafat, with the entire afternoon dedicated to contemplative vigil, praying, and reciting the holy Qur'an.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86610;I feel like I understand more now;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86620;When Abraham left Mina and was brought down to al-Aqaba, the Devil appeared to him. Gabriel said to him: 'Pelt him!' so Abraham threw seven stones at him so that he disappeared from him.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86620;Stone the Jamarat!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86630;To symbolize the mercy God had for Abraham, and replacing his son Ishmael with a ram, which Abraham then sacrificed, we perform the Eid al-Adha while at Mecca.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86630;Sacrifice a ram.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86630;Sacrifice a lamb.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86700;A group of bandits have forced our party to make a stand. We are outnumbered, but with the joy in our heart from our pilgrimage, we have a chance to defeat them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86700;These infidels will shatter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86700;Run away!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86701;We accidentally ran into a group of bandits at nightfall, and the guards that I had hired to protect my group proved their worth. All of the infidel bandits have been slain.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86701;Their loot can come to use.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86720;As you travel back home from Mecca you encounter a very poor village, where even the richest seem to starve.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86720;I must help them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86720;I can't afford to help them all..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86800;I have returned to my court a changed man. I am truly humbled before Allah, and I know that all men are equal and can live in harmony with each other.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86800;There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86900;A local Imam is berating you as you are getting older and have not yet been on hajj, which is expected of every Muslim once in his life. [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] says that as a ruler, I should be an example for my subjects.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86900;I will soon go to Mecca!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB86900;I am busy preparing a jihad, to liberate fellow Muslims!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC86900;I am busy being [Root.County.Holder.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86901;[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] is reminding you that you have promised to go to Mecca, and that while Allah is merciful in His wisdom, you have indeed promised Him to go on a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86901;I am not a good Muslim...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC86902;[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] is reminding you that you had promised to liberate good Muslims living under Christian rule, and there still exists such in the world.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA86902;I am not a good Muslim...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC1986;To lie with another [Root.GetManWoman] as you would lie with a [Root.GetManWomanOpp] is sinful, forbidden and if I was to be exposed, death would be my penalty.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA1986;I will be careful...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB1986;I... cannot risk it;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3730;The clumsy servant once again managed to cover me in chicken bones, rice and oil and I lost my temper, knocking the servant to the floor in a clatter of broken crockery. My wroth had once again gotten the best of me...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3730;Next time, your head will hang from the castle walls!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3731;watches [Root.GetTitledFirstName] lose [Root.GetHerHis] temper;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3731;It was not the first time the servant managed to spill food and dirty crockery on [From.GetTitledFirstName] and the furious [From.GetManWoman] sent the servant to the floor with a mighty slap, threatening to hang the servant's head from the castle wall if he ever did it again...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3731;You should not treat your servants like that!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3732;is stunned [Root.GetTitledFirstName] dared talk to [This.GetHerHim] like that;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB3731;Your servant will certainly be more careful from now on;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3733;is glad [Root.GetTitledFirstName] understands why it is so important to discipline bad servants;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3732;When the servant finally came to and started collecting the broken crockery, [From.GetTitledFirstName] couldn't help but comment on what had transpired before [From.GetHerHim]. Apparently, I was not to chastise my own servants, not even when they shamed me in front of guests!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3732;Don't you tell me what I might or might not do!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3733;'You did right, chastising your clumsy servant like this. From now on, he will certainly be more careful if he do not wish to have his head hung up on the castle walls!'\n[From.GetTitledFirstName] spoke approvingly of me punishing the servant for spilling food.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3733;Glad I have your approval...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3735;Everyone else ran off to chase the alleged thieves who had stolen the zakat, the money we all had contributed to give to those less fortunate, from our mosque. Instead of following them, I searched through the mosque and discovered the zakat hidden in a niche no one else had thought to look in.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3735;The imam is getting old;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3736;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] cravenness led to the zakat and [This.GetTitledFirstName] is very grateful;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3736;All but [From.GetTitledFirstName] chased after the alleged thieves and I thought [From.GetSheHe] to be a coward. When we finally got back to the mosque, without the zakat, the money collected to help the poor, [From.GetTitledFirstName] triumphantly told us it had been hidden in a niche inside the mosque all along...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3736;My thoughts were shameful, forgive me for thinking them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3737;is praised for [This.GetHerHis] cleverness;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3737;I had not really expected anyone to truly care about the missing zakat, at the time it seemed more like an excuse to make as much noise and tumult as possible. I was proven wrong when [From.GetTitledFirstName] shook my hand and thanked me for finding the money.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3737;Now the money can help the poor, that's all I ever wanted;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3740;I was one of the first to saddle my horse and chase after the bandits who had stolen the zakat, the money collected to help the poor, from our mosque. When I returned, exhausted and with filthy clothes, I was told the old imam had simply misplaced the zakat.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3740;My effort was appreciated, at least;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3745;I am content with praying five times a day in my own home but the imam scolds me if I do not show up at least once a day at the mosque for prayers and tells me I should set a better example for my subjects.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3745;I will try, may Allah be my witness;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3750;There's always something to do in the mosque. The more time I spend there, the more I appreciate the calm and I feel more connected to Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3750;Let me know if more help is needed;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3751;feels neglected by [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB3750;Let me stay here, forever;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3751;Ever since [From.GetTitledFirstName] became engaged in the mosque's different activities, or, rather, started following every order from the imam and wasting time, [From.GetSheHe] has stopped spending time with me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3751;Wife, why do you neglect me?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB3751;Husband, why do you neglect me?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC3751;Father, why do you neglect me?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD3751;Mother, why do you neglect me?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3752;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is not happy with [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s obsession with the mosque;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3752;I have had little time for [From.GetTitledFirstName] since I became engaged in the mosque's different activities and [From.GetTitledFirstName] is not happy with me neglecting [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3752;I'm sorry, but it makes me happy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3755;I try to follow the five pillars of Islam as best I can, and zakat is one of the most important and best ways to show my commitment to the faith. The few gold coins exacted from me to help the poor in form of zakat is most vital to eliminate inequality and make the world a better place for everyone.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3755;I gladly give this;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC30110;The imams are not always easy to deal with. I need to make sure I have their approval and I have both my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and my [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] giving me advice on how to earn the imam's approval.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA30110;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] suggests I should offer to rebuild the mosque;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB30110;[Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] suggests I try to scare the imams into submission;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC65036;Thank Allah in private;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65046;My beloved spouse has saved me from the fate of drunkards. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] bless [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC65050;I'll ask an Imam for advice;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65055;Why am I sick, [GetFromRelation], is [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] punishing me? I haven't done anything wrong, have I?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65056;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is very sick. [From.GetSheHe] is delirious and have started asking if [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is punishing [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD65056;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] will cure you!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA65057;If I need to be cured, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will cure me;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65165;The wine from last night did not agree with me, I woke up with a terrible hangover this morning. Now the imam is chanting again, and I keep falling asleep during the sajdah here in the mosque.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA65165;I can't... keep my... eyes... open...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB65165;Apologise, and pray some more;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65166;The imams can be a bit irritable and after my latest blunder I feel the need to be extra careful around them. Too bad I cannot really rely on myself when I am stressed to be anything else but blunt.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP65010;appreciates your trust in [This.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65167;The more stressed [From.GetTitledFirstName] gets, the more blunt and outspoken [From.GetSheHe] becomes. There have been rumors about what happened the last time the imams visited us, and none of us who experienced the awkwardness and rage of [From.GetTitledFirstName] are keen to watch that happen again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC69066; Now even the Caliph has heard about my lack of piety! The Caliph's messenger was there to give me a stern speech about my lack of faith and to make sure the bonds between the Caliph and the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church in [Root.Location.GetName] is still strong despite my lack of piety.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA69066;I will prove my piety by doubling, nay, tripling the zakat!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC69095;It seems to me [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] isn't as pious as [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] claims to be. Instead of improving relations with the imams, [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] managed to make an utter fool out of [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerselfHimself] and, indirectly, me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC69096;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] was a bit too harsh when [Root.GetSheHe] chastised me for ruining the relations with the imams! Although, I admit, I should probably have chosen less unconventional ways of assuring their support...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC69100;The lack of piety I have observed in one of the courtiers makes me worried. I wouldn't want to accuse anyone of not being a good Muslim, but if my suspicions are correct then something needs to be done!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB69100;Expose the courtier as not a good Muslim;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC69101;Faith has never been one of my great strengths, I do believe in Allah but I have trouble accepting all the rituals and demands the imams feel necessary. [From.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me about this, I hadn't even realized my lack of piety was so noticeable.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC69102;All those rituals and demands the imams feel necessary to prove one's piety is pure nonsense. Despite my feelings about those unnecessary, empty gestures I have always been careful to not show my lack of piety, but perhaps not careful enough. If I don't pay [From.GetTitledFirstName] fifty gold [From.GetSheHe] will expose my lack of faith to everyone!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC75005;There is no man better at increasing the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church's opinion of me or teach me to become a more pious Muslim than my [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC3411;I had two men pleading for my mercy in my court today. Both of them had committed the same crime, stolen an object of minor value - one a bread and the other some rice. The bread stealer was beheaded, the rice thief absolved.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3411;This is my court, I may be as arbitrary as I wish;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3412;ponders your judgement: good or bad?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3412;I witnessed [From.GetTitledFirstName] judge the two men and [From.GetHerHis] verdict made me ponder the matter for several days. Why would [From.GetTitledFirstName] sentence one man to be beheaded and absolve the other when they had committed the same crime?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3412;[From.GetSheHeCap] is too arbitrary;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA3413;is displeased [Root.GetTitledFirstName] disagrees with [This.GetHerHis] judgement;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB3412;[From.GetTitledFirstName] must be wiser than me;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB3413;is pleased [Root.GetTitledFirstName] agrees with [This.GetHerHis] judgement;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3413;The men, whose similar crimes I judged arbitrarily, gave [From.GetTitledFirstName] something to ponder. I had all but forgotten about it when [From.GetTitledFirstName] finally got the courage to discuss it with me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3413;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thinks I am a bad person for ruling so arbitrary!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB3413;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thought my judgement to be wiser than [From.GetSheHe] could understand;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3476;A Christian priest came to my court today to talk about matters of faith, but it soon became clear he only wanted to convert us to his faith! As a zealous Muslim I believe I did the right thing when I gave the order to imprison this infidel.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3476;A suitable punishment for an infidel...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3477;I watched, partly horrified, partly filled with admiration, as the infidel was dragged out of the dining hall and into [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s prison.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP3478;The infidel belongs in prison, [This.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3478;I was still shaking with rage at the infidel's outrageous words when [From.GetTitledFirstName] took the opportunity to whisper: 'Good work' in my ear.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC100550;The [Root.Religion.GetName] imams are constantly pestering me about religion, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and money to the zakat. No matter what I do, promise to pray more or read the Qur'an more thoroughly they won't leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB100550;Allah, help me be a better Muslim!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC100551;I find it curious that the [From.Religion.GetName] imams are constantly pestering [From.GetTitledFirstName] no matter what [From.GetSheHe] promises to do or no matter how much money [From.GetSheHe] gives for the zakat.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB100552;It's not only the imams who are greedy...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC100553;It seems as if no one wants to help me for fear of upsetting the [Root.Religion.GetName] imams, not even my friend [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA100553;The pestering imams are getting worse!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC100554;[From.GetTitledFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] had a great advice for me on how to stop the [Root.Religion.GetName] imams pestering me and [From.GetSheHe] got my undivided attention. The problem, though, was that [From.GetTitledFirstName] wanted payment for [From.GetHerHis] advice!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC100555;My advice to [From.GetTitledFirstName] was very simple: just pay the [From.Religion.GetName] imams and they'll stop pestering you for, oh perhaps a few weeks? Though I could have shared this for free I decided to test how much [From.GetTitledFirstName] wanted to be left alone by the [From.Religion.GetName] imams and demanded money for the advice.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC1632;I find religion fascinating, especially when the Qur'an talk of heathens and infidels, and how they shall be struck down!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC2132;My little [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] always has [From.GetHerHis] nose in the Qur'an, and spends all [From.GetHerHis] time among the imams.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC1732;People are naive fools, laughing, dancing and nodding like puppets to the false tune played by imams. Charlatans all!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC1733;The imam's admonishment bored me to tears, then he told my [GetFromRelation] about my cynicism. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] tried beating it out of me...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3010;I was shamefully caught in action with a beautiful servant today by [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName]. [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHeCap] scolded me and lectured me in the virtues of chastity.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3010;I wish I could ignore [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3371;I told the imam about my ambitions and asked if there were anything he could do to help me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3456;I expressed my views on the whole religion and 'Allah' thing a bit too loud and got into a lot of trouble with an imam because of it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3456;Allah is dead!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC4041;The imam accused a couple of villagers of blasphemy after he heard them take Allah's name in vain. The blacksmith did it when he hit his thumb with the hammer, the stablemaster when a horse kicked him and the cook when a rat fell into the stew.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC5026;My subjects does not like the new impaling punishment and, led by the imams, show their umbrage by throwing rotten vegetables at me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA5026;Vegetables won't stop me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6030_MUS;I am speaking in tongues, screaming obscenities at random times, most often when the imam is talking and am sometimes lying on the ground writhing in apparent pain. I seldom remember these things and people believe me to be possessed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6030_MUS;Begone, foul djinn!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6031_MUS;By reciting The Throne Verse from the Qur'an and invoking Allah's help the imam managed to repair the damage in me caused by sihr or witchcraft. To be on the safe side, we also recited together the three last suras from the Qur'an: Surat al-Ikhlas (The Fidelity), Surat al-Falaq (The Dawn) and Surat al-Nas (Mankind).;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6031_ALL;Once again, to be on the safe side...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC105000;It is a dire decision, to ask the Chief Qadi to grant me divorce from my husband [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]. I must be certain this is what I want before I make this decision...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105000;I have decided!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105001;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] asks the Chief Qadi [This.GetTitledFirstName] for a divorce;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105000;I cannot make this decision now...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came to me to ask to be granted a divorce from her husband [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]. I reminded [From.GetTitledFirstName] about the iddah period, the month she would have to wait before the divorce came through, and asked if her husband [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] would demand compensation and the return of the mahr, the wedding gift her husband gave her when they married.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105001;If you have no regrets after a month, you may be divorced;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105002;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] grants [This.GetTitledFirstName] her desired divorce;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105001;No, I cannot justify granting you a divorce;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105003;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] denies [This.GetTitledFirstName] the divorce;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105002;The Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me what if my husband [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] demanded compensation and the return of my mahr, the gift he gave me at the wedding and told me what would happen to any child of our union. He also told me I must wait a month, the iddah period, before I could be divorced or, if I was pregnant, until the child was born.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105002;A month I must wait, then;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105002;Until this child is born, then;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105002;I have changed my mind, I don't want the divorce!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105003;The Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not grant me a divorce and told me that from what I told him he saw no reason to grant me a divorce from [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105003;I must accept this marriage then;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105004;The iddah period has gone and if I am truly certain I want a divorce from [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] I will have it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105004;Yes! I am no longer married to [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105004;During the iddah period I have changed my mind, I don't want a divorce;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105005;My wife [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] has gone to Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] and asked for a divorce! If she still wants it after the iddah period, a month, then our marriage will be no more...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105005;If that's what she wants...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105005;NO! I won't allow it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105006;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] tries to stop [This.GetTitledFirstName] from getting the divorce;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105006;I was on my way home, thinking of ways to tell my husband [From.GetTitledFirstName] that I had asked the Chief Qadi for a divorce, when [From.GetTitledFirstName] caught up with me and asked me why I wanted a divorce! I told [From.GetTitledFirstName] my reasons and he pleaded that I should reconsider, told me he did not want me to divorce him...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105006;No, I don't want to be married to you, I want that divorce!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105007;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] will not change her mind about the divorce;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105006;Fine, but then things are going to have to change!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105007;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] decides to stay with [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105007;I pleaded with [From.GetTitledFirstName], promised her all she would want if only she wouldn't leave me! She told me about her reasons and I told her I would change, that I would do anything, anything!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105007;But [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not change her mind;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105007;[From.GetTitledFirstName] promised not to leave me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105010;I grow more worried for every day no Chief Qadi has been selected. It is as if [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] does not care if just judgement is brought to those who deserve it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105010;I should suggest one of my courtiers!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105011;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] suggests a suitable person for the post of Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105010;I would be the best candidate!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105010;One of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s vassals would be most suitable;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105010;Surely [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] already knows the best person for Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105011;[From.GetTitledFirstName] worries that the people of my realm lacks just judgement when I still haven't chosen a Chief Qadi to take care of all legal matters. To ease [From.GetHerHis] worry, [From.GetTitledFirstName] came to me and suggested someone who [From.GetSheHe] believe would make an excellent Chief Qadi.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105011;Yes, that courtier would be perfect;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105012;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] accepts [This.GetTitledFirstName] as [Root.GetHerHis] new Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105011;No, he won't do;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105013;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] dismisses [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s candidate;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105011;Yes, [From.GetTitledFirstName], you would be a perfect Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105014;is granted the title of Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105011;No, I will not grant you the title of Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105014;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to make [This.GetTitledFirstName] Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTE105011;I agree, he would make an excellent Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTF105011;No, he will not become Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105012;I had no idea [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] would suggest me as [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s new Chief Qadi! The letter congratulating me to my new position and the order to appear before [From.GetTitledFirstName] as soon as possible was bewildering, I almost did not believe it at first.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105012;Thank you, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105013;The new Chief Qadi, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], thanks [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105013;I suggested that [From.GetTitledFirstName] would be [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s new Chief Qadi and waited with bated breath as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] pondered this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105013;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] accepted my candidate as Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105013;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] dismissed my suggestion...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105014;It felt preposterous, almost insulting, to suggest myself as the new Chief Qadi for [From.GetTitledFirstName] but there were no better candidate I could have thought of than myself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105014;I am the new Chief Qadi! Fear my justice!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not want me as Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC1010;I imagined a situation which became more and more intimidating, with an outcome that could mean life or death. I swallowed hard and decided that I would...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105020;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s choice for the Chief Qadi position is disastrous! The man's judgement is severely distorted and there will be no justice as long as he holds the post!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105020;Even this courtier would be better as Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105021;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] suggests a more suitable person for the post of Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105020;Why, even I would make a better Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105020;I know a vassal of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] who would be better;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105020;Quench my anger and do nothing;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105021;Fuming with anger at what [From.GetTitledFirstName] called 'another disastrous judgement of your Chief Qadi!', [From.GetTitledFirstName] suggested I would choose another person for the very important position as Chief Qadi.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105021;You are right, your courtier would be a better choice;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105025;The former Chief Qadi, [This.GetTitledFirstName], is dismissed from the position;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105022;The new Chief Qadi is [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105021;I see no reason to dismiss the current Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105023;is disappointed [Root.GetTitledFirstName] did not follow [This.GetHerHis] recommendation for Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105021;I agree, you would make a better Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTE105021;This vassal of mine would make a better Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105023;The current Chief Qadi is such a disastrous choice, with his arbitrary judgements and insufficient knowledge of the laws, that I had to suggest a new candidate for this position. [From.GetTitledFirstName] would make a much better Chief Qadi and so I told [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and waited with bated breath as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] pondered this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105023;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is the new Chief Qadi! Praise Allah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105023;I was dismissed and told not to interfere in this matter again;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105024;I inadvertently insulted the old Chief Qadi when I suggested that I would make better judgements than he and knew the laws much better than him, but I saw no other way to get rid of him. After all, it was [From.GetTitledFirstName] who would judge if I was a better person for the position than the hopefully soon former Chief Qadi.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105025;May [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] be hit with sixty shoes! That son of a dog coaxed [From.GetTitledFirstName] into revoking my title as Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105025;May Allah destroy [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s house!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105030;The Qur'an says: 'O you who believe! Intoxicants and games of chance and sacrificing to stones set up and dividing by arrows are only an uncleanness, the Shaitan's work, shun it therefore that you may be successful.' It is said that those who indulge in wine and other intoxicants will be punished by eighty lashes so they may know the wrongness of their path.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105030;Eighty lashes for that drunkard!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105031;is lashed eighty times by Chief Qadi [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105030;Show mercy and the drunkard may repent;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105032;The drunkard [This.GetTitledFirstName] is saved from the eighty lashes by [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105030;Do nothing, the drunkard may drink himself to death;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105031;I stumbled drunkenly into Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] who smelled the wine I had drunk on my breath and ordered my arrest. The next day I got my punishment: eighty lashes!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105031;The lashes made me cry out in pain...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105031;I will never drink again, may Allah be my witness!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105031;The wine will take the pain away...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105031;Wine will never again touch my tongue!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105032;The wine was aplenty and when I left my company I was more than unsteady on my feet. I must have drunk enough to become unconscious, for when I woke up it was in Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s room, who told me that if I donated a small sum of money to charity and promised to never drink again [From.GetSheHe] would let me go without punishment.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105032;I promised but all I could think of was a can of wine to cure my headache;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105032;May Allah be my witness, I promise to never drink again!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89000;You have come to share more things than your husband with one of his other wives. The mutual feelings of love and affection that exist between the two of you is something you have simply never felt with [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89000;I feel alive again!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89001;The most disturbing rumor has come to your attention. It seems two of your wives have sinfully engaged in carnal pleasures with each other! The rest of the household must be laughing at you behind your back... something must be done about this shameful crime.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89001;Who am I to stand in the way of love? Just be more discreet.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB89001;This disgraceful behavior ends now!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC89001;They will pay with their lives...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89002;Your two sinful wives, possessed by a depraved and unnatural love for each other, have eloped! Try as they might, your guards can't find them anywhere in your palace and a carriage in the courtyard outside has been reported stolen!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89002;Send out riders! Find them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89003;Leading your scouts forward, you intercept your fleeing wives in their carriage at the edge of a deep ravine. You dismount and approach the carriage, but as you draw near it suddenly takes off towards the ravine. Moments before their horses leap off the edge, you see your wives clasping each other's hands...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89003;NO!!!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89005;I should be first amongst the wives of [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]. That I am not shames us both. For his sake, if not my own, I should act.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89005;Poison [Root.Spouse.Spouse.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB89005;Woo [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC89005;No, I must accept my station.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89006;The first of your wives has passed away unexpectedly, with your healers claiming nothing could be done. They suspect poison may be the cause. [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], who is now your new first wife, can barely conceal her elation. As the guards move her belongings into her new quarters, one of them confiscates a suspicious half-empty vial...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89006;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], my dear wife. Let us bury the past and look to the future!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB89006;Is... is that poison? Guards, move her to the dungeons instead!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC89006;Force her to drink the vial's remaining content!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89007;It seems one of your husband's lesser wives has tried to poison you in a desperate bid to become his first wife! It was blind luck alone that made you discover this attempt on your life before it was too late.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89007;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] must be told of this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89008;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], the first of your beloved wives, is very upset. She claims to have caught one of your lesser wives in the act of poisoning her food! Evidence uncovered by your household guards seem to verify this claim.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89008;It pains me, but the punishment for this must be death...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB89008;Let her contemplate the error of her ways in the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC89008;I can't be fighting all your battles for you, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89009;I can't fight all your battles for you, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]! Just tell her not to do it again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89009;But... but she tried to KILL me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89010;One of your beloved wives covets the position of first wife, and has been trying to woo you into elevating her to that status.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89010;Yes, she would make a good first wife...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB89010;No. [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is first amongst my wives, now and always.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89011;That witch [Root.Spouse.Spouse.GetFirstName] has somehow ensnared [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] with her black magic. She has manipulated him into granting her your rightful position as the first among his wives!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89011;Quick! Where is the poison?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB89011;If that is his wish...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89012;Tragic news, Master! Your new first wife has passed away, and your healers all agree that poison was the cause. Your former first wife, overcome with jealousy, has made no attempt to hide her guilt in this crime. What should be done with her?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA89012;Release her. She must truly love me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB89012;Send the witch to rot in prison!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC89012;As my dear first wife has died, so shall she!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC20050;Your charity work in [Root.Location.GetName] goes well. The Prophet (may Allah honor him and grant him peace) would approve of your Master's actions. Perhaps you should send word.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA20050;Make it so!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC20051;Your [GetLordSpiritualName] reports from [From.Location.GetName] that his charity work on your behalf is proceeding well. The poor have been fed and your pious standing has improved.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA20051;We can still do much good, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP20051;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle] is informed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME20050;Piety Gained;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC39500;The infidel dhimmis in [Root.GetName] are now a minority, and most people have embraced [Root.Holder.Religion.GetName] Islam!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA39500;Allah be Praised!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA39501;Lost Souls!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP7509;Informed you do not agree.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA61240;So be it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC100111;There's no way I'll help [From.GetTitledFirstName], I might lose my job!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP89010;The [Root.Spouse.GetTitle] is wooed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP89007;Murder attempt discovered!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP89003;Your scouts search for your missing wives.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105035;There have been rumors circling the court that a vassal of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is sleeping with a woman other than his wives. The man cannot be a true Muslim if he has committed zina!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105035;The Chief Qadi would know what to do!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105036;The Chief Qadi [This.GetTitledFirstName] hears about the man having a lover and committing zina;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105035;I should confront him myself, make him repent to Allah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105037;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] confronts [This.GetTitledFirstName] about sinning and committing zina;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105035;It is not for me to judge others;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105036;To accuse someone of committing zina, having sexual intercourse with another man or woman other than your spouse, is something no one should take lightly. [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me of the rumors circling the court of [From.GetHerHis] liege [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] about a vassal being more than friendly with a woman...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105036;Confront the accused one;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105038;is accused of committing zina and confronted by Chief Qadi [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105036;If you care so much about this, why don't you confront him yourself?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105039;Chief Qadi [Root.GetTitledFirstName] dismisses [This.GetTitledFirstName] accusations;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105036;Don't come to me with rumors only!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105037;The days with my lover has been the most joyful days of my life but [From.GetTitledFirstName] threatening to bring the whole affair to the Chief Qadi made those few days feel petty and the joy I had felt bedraggled. Committing zina is a sin but I couldn't resist her...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105037;Try to bribe [From.GetTitledFirstName] to keep quiet;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105040;The money from [Root.GetTitledFirstName] quiets [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105037;I promise I will never see her again!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105040;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s promise convinces [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105037;Our love is sacred, no matter what the Qur'an says!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPC105040;might go to the Chief Qadi with the matter;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105038;Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] lectured me on the sin of committing zina, but all I could think of was my dear love, waiting for me in our own little hideout.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105038;You have no witnesses, only rumors and they are false!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105041;is convinced of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] innocence;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105041;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] denying the rumors being true only strengthens the Chief Qadi [This.GetTitledFirstName] suspicions;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105038;Promise to break it up with lover;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105042;believes that when [This.GetSheHe] sees that it is true;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105038;I don't deny it and I refuse to do anything about it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105043;will find a proper punishment for [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s sins;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105039;The silence following my accusations, that a vassal of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] was committing zina, was deafening. Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me several questions about the accusations, the rumors I've heard and what I thought about the matter, which was rather flattering.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105039;But then [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] wouldn't do something about it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105039;I am free to confront the accused, but without [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s assistance!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105039;Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] assured me the sinner would be punished;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105040;I hadn't really expected [From.GetTitledFirstName] to react to my accusations about [From.GetHerHim] committing zina and me threatening to go to the Chief Qadi with the matter in exactly that way...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOTPA105040;My greed got the better of me and I promised to say nothing to no one;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOTPB105040;I will tell Chief Qadi about this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOTPC105040;[From.GetTitledFirstName] ignored my threat! I will tell the Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOTPD105040;The Chief Qadi would not believe me anyway;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOTPE105040;[From.GetTitledFirstName] promised to never see the woman again, but I will still tell the Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOTPF105040;[From.GetTitledFirstName] promise to never see the woman again is enough for me;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105041;I confronted [From.GetTitledFirstName] with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s accusations about [From.GetHerHim] committing zina and the rumors [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] based this upon. [From.GetTitledFirstName] denied everything and assured me [From.GetSheHe] is a pious Muslim who would never do anything to affront Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105041;I believe [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105044;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s belief that [This.GetTitledFirstName] is innocent gladdens [This.GetHerHis] heart;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105041;I doubt [From.GetTitledFirstName] is sincere, but I can't do anything;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105044;Chief Qadi [Root.GetTitledFirstName] doubts [This.GetTitledFirstName] innocence but can do nothing;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPC105044;The punishment for committing zina is stoning, but the Chief Qadi is satisfied with one hundred lashes;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPD105044;The merciful Chief Qadi [Root.GetTitledFirstName] decides to trust [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s word;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPE105044;The Chief Qadi does not know what to do, [This.GetTitledFirstName] escapes punishment;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105041;I need no witnesses nor confessions, [From.GetTitledFirstName] will be punished!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105042;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s accusations of [From.GetTitledFirstName] committing zina is not something to take lightly, so when I confronted [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetSheHe] confessed and confessed four times, then promised to never see [From.GetHerHis] lover ever again I stood at a loss. Should I punish [From.GetTitledFirstName] for committing zina or should I be merciful if [From.GetSheHe] stood by [From.GetHerHis] word?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105042;I do not believe you but there's nothing I can do;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105042;Your words are false, the punishment will be brought upon you;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105042;If you break your promise you will be doubly punished. Two hundred lashes!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105043;I had thought [From.GetTitledFirstName] would've shown some embarrassment, some remorse for committing zina, a crime declared punishable by stoning or a hundred lashes by the Qur'an and the Prophet himself! Instead, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not deny anything and told me the love [From.GetSheHe] felt for [From.GetHerHis] lover was sacred!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105043;I... I don't know what to do...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105043;Your punishment will be a hundred lashes!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105044;Committing zina is a crime according to the Qur'an and the Prophet, may peace be upon him, and the punishment is stoning or a hundred lashes. Regardless of what I told Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName], I still felt afraid as [From.GetSheHe] pondered my case.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105044;The hundred lashes only wounded me, not my soul nor my love!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105044;The merciful Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to spare me the punishment!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105044;I will never see my lover again, but Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided not to punish me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105044;The wounds from the hundred lashes healed more quickly than I could fathom;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88250;A messenger arrives with an invitation to all the warriors of the land to take part in Furusiyya, a great martial competition held but once per reign to determine who is the greatest.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88250;At last!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88250;Pah. For children playing at being men.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88251;The Furusiyya begins and the coming two months shall separate those gifted with the skills of a warrior from those who would only pretend at such.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88251;A time for heroic deeds.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88251;Alas, the ongoing war demands my attention.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88252;The Furusiyya has come to an end and the stories of its great heroes and their unfortunate victims are already spreading throughout the land.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88252;An event to remember.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88253;The Furusiyya has ended, and though I was bested by some participants, I also saw victory more than once. The promise I show as a warrior cannot be denied.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88253;I will improve.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88254;The Furusiyya has ended and my martial prowess is no longer considered idle boasting - it is proven fact. Though there were a handful of warriors gifted with skills superior to my own, the glory I won is enough to make me a hero in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88254;My enemies will fear me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88255;The Furusiyya has reached its end and not a moment too soon. My performance left much to be desired, and I would have suffered worse if some of my opponents had not pitied me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88255;I did my best...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88256;The Furusiyya has ended and though I did make a name for myself, it was not the one I had hoped for. I lost to every challenger, and when I pushed through the crowds and fled in panic in the last wrestling duel, I could hear laughter behind me...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88256;The shame of it all!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88257;The end of the Furusiyya has come, and I have learned much from the skilled warriors who attended. Both my swordsmanship and archery have improved.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88257;I am better for it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88258;The Furusiyya has reached its end, and the combat techniques I had practised did not work well against real, thinking opponents. I am not quite the fighter I thought I was...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88258;Perhaps if I improved my footwork...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88259;As my opponent skillfully plunged his blade into my belly and I fell on my back, I reflected briefly on the unfairness of the universe. Then I focused on my fading heartbeat as the blue sky above turned darker and darker...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88259;Why me?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88260;My horse bucked wildly to the side as my opponent rushed past on his camel, and I was thrown to the ground. When my senses returned, I noticed my arm was bent at a strange angle...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88260;A pox on that camel jockey!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88261;I was facing an opponent in a game of chess, and while pondering my opening moves, the game next to ours turned violent. One of the players hurled the board aside to pull out his scimitar, sending chess pieces flying everywhere. One of White's Bishops struck me in the eye.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88261;By the Prophet, that is an illegal move!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88262;To my great shame, the challenge of keeping my bowels in check during the martial competition proved too much for me. I fled home to escape the taunts of my former comrades and for a change of underwear.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88262;I should have stayed in bed this morning.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88263;Suddenly, in the middle of a frenzied melee, the crowds part to reveal a giant swordsman grinning at you. After he shows off some fancy moves with his sword, the crowds turn expectantly to you. You fling a dagger into the thug's throat and he drops dead to the wild cheers of those nearby.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88263;Who is next?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88264;There were many who doubted my fighting ability, but when we rode our horses into mock battle only to be ambushed by our opponents, I was the one who led us to victory against all odds.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88264;I am tougher than I look.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88265;As we rode our horses into battle in yet another test of skill, I devised a clever ambush against our opponents. We prevailed despite being outnumbered.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88265;Many victories will follow, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88266;Many believe that chess is the ultimate test of strategy, and if this is true, your brilliance as a general is undeniable. All who have mustered the courage to challenge you in this game have met with defeat.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88266;Checkmate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88267;You are renowned for your skills in strategy and planning, but several defeats in mock battles due to embarrassing mistakes on your part have put this reputation into question.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88267;I should have seen through that feint...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88268;No matter how hard you try, you cannot wrap your head around this stupid game called chess. Your opponents always seem to be several moves ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88268;It is a game for children and weaklings!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88269;After repeatedly falling off my horse during a competitive event, many have questioned my abilities as a warrior.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88269;Curse this saddle!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88270;I have emerged from the Furusiyya as the finest warrior of the land. I have bested all challengers, and my skills at archery and horsemanship have proved second to none.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88270;A momentous day.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88271;I have been declared the second champion of the Furusiyya. Few are those who can match my martial prowess.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88271;May my enemies quake in fear!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88272;I have been named third champion of the Furusiyya. My efforts in these competitions have proved that I belong in a small circle of elite warriors.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88272;I have fought with honor.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88273;Though I did not participate myself, I felt particularly drawn to the wrestling challenges of the Furusiyya...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88273;Such fine, strong men...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88274;While others busied themselves with martial exploits during the Furusiyya, I found the time to embark on different challenges in the many tents that have cropped up just outside the tournament grounds. Like the other fighters, however, I too suffer from battle sores...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88274;A red badge of courage.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88275;My shortcomings in the Furusiyya competitions do not seem quite as significant after helping myself to a healthy serving of wine. Though it is haram, forbidden, surely a few more drops won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88275;*hic*;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88276;A fighter had the nerve to insult me in front of several of the other attending warriors. The look on his face when I challenged him to a duel revealed him for the coward he was, but honor left him no choice but to accept. I showed no mercy when I cut him down in single combat.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88276;All arguments should be settled thus.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88277;As I waited my turn in the archery contest, I came across two bedouins, fierce warriors both, who were plotting to get back at a young noble who had dismissed them as desert rabble. I watched as they carefully cut the girth of the noble's saddle just enough to ensure it would snap during the upcoming riding challenge.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88277;Clever.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88278;As I waited my turn in the archery contest, I came across two bedouins, fierce warriors both, who were plotting to get back at a young noble who had dismissed them as desert rabble. I told them to face the man directly instead of scheming behind his back like bitter old women!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88278;No more of this cowardly intrigue!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88279;Learned men from all around the land have come to the Furusiyya to observe the spectacle and share insights and wisdom with each other. Between bouts in the wrestling arena, I spent some time listening to their discussions and learned much about how best to rule the land.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88279;I will use this knowledge.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88280;Learned men from all around the land have come to the Furusiyya to observe the spectacle and share insights and wisdom with each other. I joined one of their debates and offered my own opinions on how to govern, only to have them laugh in my face!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88280;Old fools. What do they know?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88281;Two men assigned to my cavalry wing for the upcoming mock battle were constantly at each other's throats. It was clear they would sooner fight each other than our opponents, so for the sake of our team I decided to mediate in their conflict.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88281;They agreed to set aside their differences.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88282;Two men assigned to my cavalry wing for the upcoming mock battle were constantly at each other's throats. It was clear they would sooner fight each other than our opponents, so I called them out like the bickering women they were and demanded they settle their differences in a duel.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88282;Sadly both were badly wounded and our wing suffered as a result...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88283;Riders have been sent to all the corners of the land, spreading word that the great martial competition of Furusiyya will soon be held.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88283;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88284;[From.GetTitledName] has been named first champion of my great Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88284;[From.GetTitledName] is indeed a mighty warrior.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88285;[From.GetTitledName] has performed well enough to be named second champion of my great Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88285;Let no one deny [From.GetHerHis] skill.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88286;The third champion of my Furusiyya is none other than [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88286;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88287;The great Furusiyya competition of [From.GetTitledName] has sadly been cancelled due to war.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88287;Then my skill at fighting may still see use.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88288;Master, your honored guest, [From.GetTitledName], has sadly perished during the events of the Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88288;May [From.GetSheHe] find peace in the life hereafter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88288;Tell me of the heroes, not the failures!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88289;Master, your honored guest, [From.GetTitledName], has sadly been maimed during the events of the Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88289;May [From.GetSheHe] recover swiftly, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88289;Tell me of the heroes, not the failures!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88290;Master, your honored guest, [From.GetTitledName], has sadly suffered serious wounds during the events of the Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88290;May [From.GetSheHe] recover swiftly, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88290;Tell me of the heroes, not the failures!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88291;As death closes in on me and I prepare for the life hereafter, I spare a thought for the great Furusiyya I had planned. Sadly the competition will end upon my passing, and the fighters will have to find some other way to prove their worth.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88291;May those I ruled remember me for my wisdom, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88292;Peace be upon you, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. Due to the sudden and unexpected passing of [From.GetTitledFirstName], the Furusiyya has sadly been cancelled.\n\nSigned, \n[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC88500;The holy month of Ramadan is upon us, and all faithful Muslims, save the infirm and those on a journey, must observe the fast during daylight hours.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88500;Let the fast commence!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88501;Ramadan is a blessed time for charity and kindness, and in that spirit you could release the prisoners languishing in your dungeons...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88501;Yes, set them free.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88501;No, they are where they belong.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88502;The Prophet, may Allah honor him and grant him peace, teaches the importance of charity and good deeds, especially during the holy month of Ramadan. There are many poor in [Root.Location.GetName] who could be helped if you but parted with some of your treasury.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88502;Yes, make it so. Distribute alms to the poor.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88502;No, I would not disturb their fast by giving them means to buy food...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88503;Now is the time for prayers and devoted reading of the Qur'an. After the sun has set, you could recite the Qur'an through Tarawih prayers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88503;Yes, I will thus draw nearer to Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88503;No, I do not have the time to spare.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88504;The strict fast you have been observing during the daylight hours of Ramadan has weakened you to the point of illness. As the ill are exempted from fasting, there would be no shame or loss of piety if you abandoned the fast and made up for the lost days at a later time. If you continue, however, there could be serious repercussions to your health...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88504;Yes, I need time to recover from this...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88504;No, I feel fine!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88505;Your decision to continue fasting despite your illness has proved a costly one. You have become infirm with weakness due to lack of food and water, and left with no choice but to interrupt the fast.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88505;Perhaps next year...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88506;The fast you have observed during Ramadan has taught you the value of moderation in all things, and the dangers of indulgence and excess. You feel closer to Allah.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88506;I am a new person.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88507;You have given generously to the poor during Ramadan and performed many good deeds. The urge to help those in need comes naturally to you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88507;I feel like a better person.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88508;The ongoing war demands your full attention, and you and your men can no longer continue your fast. You will have to make up the lost days at a later date.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88508;So it must be.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88509;You have become ill and will have to abandon the fast. The lost days will have to be made up at a later date.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88509;So it is.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88510;The end of Ramadan approaches, and that means the holiday of Eid ul-Fitr is upon us. The preparations for the planned feast to celebrate this have already been made, and now the time has come to invite your vassals to your palace. What say you, Master?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88510;Send out the invitations!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88510;No, I have a headache. Cancel the festivities!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88511;Peace be upon you, [Root.GetTitledName]. The end of Ramadan draws near, and to celebrate the holiday of Eid ul-Fitr I have decided to hold a great feast in my palace. You are of course invited.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88511;I am honored to accept.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88511;No, I have other plans.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88512;Peace be upon you, [Root.GetTitledName]. I give thanks for your invitation to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr at your palace, but I regret to inform you I cannot attend.\n\nYour servant,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88512;So [From.GetSheHe] dares refuse!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88513;The great banquet you ordered held to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr and the end of Ramadan was a rousing success! The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all. Your guests seemed suitably impressed by your wealth and generosity.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88513;Eid Mubarak!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88514;The great banquet held by [From.GetTitledName] to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr and the end of Ramadan was a splendid occasion. The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC88515;To celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, perhaps you should present a gift to your beloved wife.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88515;Of course! I will buy her a golden necklace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88515;No, my affection for her is gift enough.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88516;To celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, perhaps you should present gifts to your beloved wives.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88516;Yes, but only for [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], my dear first wife.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB88516;Of course, they will all see my love!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC88516;My affection for them is gift enough.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88517;The hunger pains you experience during the fast have become unbearable due to your gluttonous nature. With the sun still high in the sky, you break into the pantry and help yourself to the food inside while tears stream down your face...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88517;Mmhf... c-can't.. help myself...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88518;Overcome with lust and in broad daylight during the fast, you sinfully engage in the pleasures of the flesh with a serving girl.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88518;I should not have done that...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88519;Though the fast requires you to abstain from food and drink during the daylight hours, you helped yourself to enough wine to fall into a drunken stupor.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88519;I-I'm schorry...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88520;Many in [Root.Location.GetName] have donated generously to provide for the poor during the holy month of Ramadan. The gold has been gathered in an urn but when you approach it to donate your own share, your greedy nature results in your coin purse gaining weight instead of losing it...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA88520;No one will miss a few coins...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC88521;As a cynical unbeliever, you do your best to uphold the appearance of observing the fast, but behind closed doors you do not think twice about eating and drinking to your heart's content, be it day or night. One day you are caught in the act...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC105050;I wish to decorate the new mosque with abstract arabesque motifs such as quotes from the Qur'an and intricate calligraphy is something my liege's new Court Calligrapher should be more than able to do.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105050;With the Court Calligrapher's help, the mosque should look wonderful!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105051;Court Calligrapher [This.GetTitledFirstName] is asked to create designs for the decoration of the new Mosque;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105050;I should not disturb the Court Calligrapher with such a petty task;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105051;A message from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived, with a most respectful tone to it and a humble request for calligraphy of Quranic verses for the decoration of a newly erected mosque.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105051;I would be more than honored to create designs for the decoration;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105052;The calligraphy Quranic verses is much appreciated by [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105052;Despite [Root.GetTitledFirstName] hard work with the calligraphy Quranic verses, the designs and effort is not appreciated by [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105051;My work would only be spoiled in a mosque of such petty calibre;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105053;The Court Calligrapher [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s refusal is most disappointing to [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105052;I received samples of what the Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName] had envisioned for the decoration of the mosque, taken special care to the few Quranic verses I had felt most important to adorn the roof and walls of the mosque.;;;;;;;;;x

The short answer was humiliating in its simplicity:;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105053;'No' was the answer I got!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105054;I sent [From.GetTitledFirstName] some short samples of my previous works and the design of the Quranic verses [From.GetSheHe] had specifically asked for.

EVTOPTB105054;[From.GetSheHeCap] thought the designs was terrible!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105054;[From.GetSheHeCap] chided me for not taking this seriously!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPB105067;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] refusal to help pay for the Golden Qur'an disappoints [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105067;With a rough estimate of what the materials for the Golden Qur'an would cost and a time estimate of about six months I managed to make [From.GetTitledFirstName] more than interested in my 'dream' of making a Golden Qur'an...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105067;[From.GetTitledFirstName] agreed to pay for whatever I might need!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105067;My plan worked, [From.GetTitledFirstName] agreed to pay for some of the 'materials'!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105067;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to pay for 'something so foolish!';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105068;It has been six months since I agreed to help my Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName] with [From.GetHerHis] dream of creating a Golden Qur'an and I am starting to become suspicious. I have heard no word of progress, nor seen any sign of the Golden Qur'an or its design and I am starting to believe my Court Calligrapher might have deceived me for money!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105068;Imprison Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105068;Banish Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105068;Make Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName] pay;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105068;Forgive Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName], it's only money!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105069;The Golden Qur'an I promised [From.GetTitledFirstName] I would create for the money [From.GetSheHe] gave me to pay for the materials is of course a figment of imagination, a scheme to lure my liege of some money. Somehow [From.GetTitledFirstName] have found out about my scheme and I am being punished by...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105069;...being thrown into [From.GetHerHis] dungeons!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105069;...banished from [From.GetHerHis] court!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105069;...my wealth is taken from me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105075;The ghazal's poetic expression of both the pain of separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain is the perfect poetic form for my next song!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105075;I will dedicate this to [Root.Liege.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105076;Court Musician [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s new song is dedicated to [Root.GetHerHis] liege's wife [Root.Liege.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105075;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] will be the first to hear it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105077;Court Musician [Root.GetTitledFirstName] sing [Root.GetHerHis] new song for [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105075;I need more time before I can master this form;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105076;My husband's Court Musician [From.GetTitledFirstName] has a wonderful voice and I could barely keep from blushing as I heard [From.GetHerHim] sing [From.GetHerHis] ghazal song about the pain of separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105076;Wonderful! Our court would be less beautiful without your voice;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105078;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s appreciation of [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s song gladdens [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105076;It is not proper for a man to court a married woman!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105077;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s husband [This.GetTitledFirstName] hears about the Court Musician courting his wife;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105077;The Court Musician's words and his singing brought justice to the poetic form ghazal, a poetic expression of both the pain of separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105077;Here, a small token of mine and [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s appreciation...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105078;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] both appreciated Court Musician [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s song;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105077;How dare you court my wife with this song!?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPC105078;Court Musician [This.GetTitledFirstName] is imprisoned for courting [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] with a song;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105077;Play it just one more time, please?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105079;Court Musician [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s song is appreciated by [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105078;As I sang my song, I started to feel true pain of separation from my love and still see the beauty of love. The ghazal was my masterpiece and as I let the last few notes die away I felt tears streaming down my face...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was as touched by the song as I were;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105078;Both [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] appreciated my song;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not appreciate me singing this song to his wife!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105100;'Through my veins both love and blood flows\nMy beloved fills me as love empties me of myself...'\nAs I struggle with my poem I searched through the garden for an inspiration of some sort...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105100;I find inspiration in [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and read her the poem;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105101;Court Musician [Root.GetTitledFirstName] inspiration is awakened by [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105100;The garden inspired me, present the poem to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105102;Court Musician [Root.GetTitledFirstName] inspiration is awakened by [Root.GetHerHis] liege [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s garden;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105100;No inspiration is to be had, the poem will remain unfinished...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105101;My husband's garden is an easy place to find inspiration within, and I was slowly walking through it when the Court Poet [From.GetTitledFirstName] startled me. [From.GetSheHeCap] asked my forgiveness and recited a poem [From.GetTitledFirstName] claimed to have gotten inspiration to when [From.GetSheHe] saw me walking.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105101;Not exactly appropriate, but very sweet;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105103;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has nothing but kind words for Court Poet [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s poetry;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105101;Go away! What will my husband say?!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105102;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is mortified and tells [Root.GetHerHis] husband [This.GetTitledFirstName] about the Court Poet's poetry;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105102;The poem did not rhyme, why did it not rhyme? Shouldn't every poem rhyme? I was assured by the Court Poet that not all poetry rhymed and I did like the two first sentences:\n\n'Through my veins both love and blood flows\nMy beloved fills me as love empties me of myself...';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105102;Good work my dear poet, good work!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105103;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] appreciated the poem, although it did not rhyme;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105102;Did you try to seduce my wife with this!? Imprison him!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPC105103;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] imprisons Court Poet [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105102;This is the most beautiful poem I ever heard!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105103;My new poem was clearly appreciated, people were asking me to make copies of it or just hear me recite it for them. I tried to do this as inconspicuously as possible, I did not want any jealous wife or husbands try to harm me just for a sweet poems sake...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105103;Seems as [From.GetTitledFirstName] liked it...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105103;[From.GetTitledFirstName] even paid me for a copy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105103;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not appreciate me getting inspiration from his wife...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105103;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was moved to tears by my poem;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105150;As the Cupbearer I shall serve drinks at the table, guard against poison in my [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s cup and sometimes test the wine by tasting it to make sure no one has poisoned it. Too bad I do not like my liege and might accidentally serve bad wine...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105150;Poison the wine [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] will drink;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105151;The poison was discovered before any damage was done;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105150;I dare not risk my position at [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s court;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105151;My trustworthy Cupbearer [From.GetTitledFirstName] served the wine as always and even though it did taste a bit strange I did not reflect upon it until it was too late! The wine must have been poisoned, why else would I feel this way?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105151;Imprison that [From.GetManWoman]! Obey my voice!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105152;Cupbearer [This.GetTitledFirstName] is imprisoned by the lunatic [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105151;A night of stomach cramps convinced me of [From.GetTitledFirstName] guilt!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105152;The poison caused nothing more than stomach cramps, Cupbearer [This.GetTitledFirstName] is imprisoned;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105151;I am merciful when I imprison you, [From.GetTitledFirstName]! You should be dead!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPC105152;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s imprisons Cupbearer [This.GetTitledFirstName] but would rather see [This.GetHerHim] dead;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105151;For Cupbearer is death! I mean, kill [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTE105151;For your treason you will die!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTF105151;I would kill you myself if I had the strength!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105152;It seems my treason reached the wrong ears! The poison in the wine, why did I trust it to kill [From.GetTitledFirstName]? I should have done it with my own two hands!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105152;At least the bastard is sick as a dog!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105152;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not even get sick!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105152;The poison made [From.GetHerHim] insane at least...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105200;I took a look at some of the architecture plans for the buildings being built in [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s realm and what I saw chilled my blood. There were so many things that could be improved, so many small faults that could be solved if only [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] would listen to me and provide the money necessary for these changes.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105200;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] must approve these changes!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP105201;Chief Architect [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s suggests several changes in the building plans for [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105200;I need more time, there's probably more flaws I can find...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105201;'You see, this small change might mean five years more without repairs, and this is just absurd, what were they thinking? Let me have the money needed to do these changes and I promise you...'\nThe Chief Architect pointed out several flaws and faults with the building plans and asked for money to prevent them.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105201;Whatever you need, just make these buildings sturdy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPA105202;Chief Architect [This.GetTitledFirstName] is given the money needed to correct flaws in the buildings;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105201;No, I don't want to waste money on this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPB105202;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has no desire to waste money on the buildings;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105202;I saw before me how the buildings would stand tall and beautiful, without the flaws I had found in the building plans. Before me stood the [From.GetManWoman] who held this in [From.GetHerHis] hand and I waited for [From.GetTitledFirstName] decision, eager to get out there and make the buildings flawless.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105202;'No money for improvements', [From.GetTitledFirstName] said;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105202;I got the money but now I want to keep it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105202;I can do so much, save so many buildings from imperfections!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105203;Another building collapsed today! I thought my Chief Architect [From.GetTitledFirstName] had found and corrected these flaws but it seems like [From.GetSheHe] squandered the money away. What should the punishment for this be?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105203;Imprison Chief Architect [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105203;Banish Chief Architect [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105203;Make Chief Architect [From.GetTitledFirstName] pay;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD105203;I'm sure [From.GetTitledFirstName] did [From.GetHerHis] best to stop it from happening;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105204;I should have used the money for improvements! Another building collapsed today and [From.GetTitledFirstName] holds me responsible for it. I tremble at the mere thought of whatever punishment [From.GetTitledFirstName] see fit for my failure...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA105204;Imprisonment!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105204;Banishment!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC105204;My wealth... forfeited!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91200;Alcoholic beverages are considered haraam in the Islamic faith - forbidden. This, however, has not stopped you from consuming copious amounts of wine and getting plastered on a regular basis.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91200;*hic*;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91201;Your attraction to those of your same sex is frowned upon by the rest of society, but there are times when you simply grow tired of keeping up appearances. The people do not look kindly on this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91201;Let them say what they want!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91202;Some visiting imams walk in on you as your servants are busily smearing your body with honey, covering you from top to bottom. For some reason they react in horror at this sight.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91202;What? I left enough for tomorrow's breakfast.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91203;It is becoming increasingly difficult to conceal your secret vice - impaling your enemies on wooden stakes and listening to their cries of despair. Concerns have been raised about how appropriate this behavior is for someone of your station.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91203;You will not rob me of the one thing I enjoy in life!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91204;Why should you settle for one woman, or two, or a dozen? The carnal pleasures of the flesh beckon, and let no man say you are undeserving!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91204;Come here, my pretty...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91205;Your enormous appetite cannot be sated. As the poor of your realm starve, your servants bring delicacies from the most distant lands to your table. A 'light lunch' for you would be enough to feed a peasant family for a week or two.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91205;Let me just remove my belt...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91206;You have been doing your best to suck the people of [Root.Location.GetName] dry of what few possessions they have. No matter how much of their wealth is channeled your way, you always want more. The lifestyle you have grown accustomed to is an expensive one indeed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91206;It is my right.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91207;The truly enlightened ruler must conserve all energy for the act of ruling itself. It is for this reason that you have expanded your staff of servants tenfold. Tedious activities such as walking, bringing food to your mouth or the wiping of your regal behind are a thing of the past for you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91207;Ah, yes...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91208;More and more of your waking hours are being spent comparing your worldly possessions with those of other rulers. For someone of your same station to have a more lavish palace or prettier garments is simply unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91208;I deserve only the very best.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91209;Your foul temper is frequently discussed in hushed voices among your palace staff. Furniture, silverware, mirrors - everything is fair game when your mood turns bad and you feel the need to break or throw something. If your palace was ever looted, would anyone be able to tell the difference?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91209;It can all be replaced.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91210;You order the construction of a massive bronze statue over the main entrance of [Root.Location.GetName] depicting yourself holding a raised sword, challenging the very heavens to strike you down if they dare. This generous gift to the people will help them remember your splendor and brilliance.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91210;They should be thankful I am their ruler.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91211;Your deceitfulness and guile sometimes serve you well, but it has also earned you a reputation among your subjects as someone who is not to be trusted. They simply do not see you as a man of honor.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91211;Honour is a weakness I cannot afford.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91212;While there are some rulers who take an active role in military affairs, the safety of the palace life is far more appealing to you. Why, if you ventured beyond the palace gates, something could hurt you!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91212;Guards, I don't like the way that child looked at me...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91213;While there are always those who moan and mutter about the need to continually better oneself and strive for improvement, you are quite content with the way things are now. The land is yours to rule, you have a beautiful palace and the sun still shines warmly.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91213;There is not a single thing I would change.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91214;Justice and the rule of law do not interest you, unless they happen to coincide with your own sense of how things should be. Many of your subjects are grumbling about how you seem to hold yourself above the laws they have to observe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91214;I AM the law.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91215;Your cynical view of all religious matters has resulted in you only observing those elements of the Muslim faith you find convenient and ignoring the rest. Some of your subjects are muttering about this lack of piousness on your part.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91215;Oh, let them mutter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91216;You suspect everyone around you of treachery, to the point where your servants and staff are terrified of even breathing in your presence. The size and influence of your palace guard has increased tenfold as everything, good or bad, has to pass through them before reaching you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91216;They will not catch me unawares.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91217;You take great pleasure in inflicting cruel punishments on your servants and subjects. If there is no reason to punish them, you find it easy enough to invent one.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91217;I will teach you not to blink so much in my presence...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91218;You always seem to be thinking several steps ahead of the people near you. There are few people alive who can match your mental prowess, and when your intellect is focused on a single problem, people know a solution will be found.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91218;Allah (glorified and exalted be He) does not play dice.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91219;Your decision to put aside your carnal desires and lead a life of celibacy is applauded by the people, either because they admire your sacrifice or because they are relieved you are less likely to procreate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91219;I did it for you!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91220;As a dedicated scholar, you have gained many valuable insights from all the tomes you have studied. From the Quran to ancient treatises on farming techniques and history, there is great wisdom to be found in all.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91220;There is so much to learn.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91221;Your chaste and virtuous lifestyle is held as an example even far beyond the borders of those lands belonging to you. If only all men lived thus.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91221;The world would be a better place.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91222;Where other rulers often abuse their positions and give in to excess, you have always valued moderation in all things. This quality is admired by the people you rule.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91222;Indulgence leads to weakness.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91223;You are always ready to give to those less fortunate than yourself, and when a rockslide destroyed the homes of several poor families in [Root.Location.GetName], you offered them temporary lodgings in your palace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91223;Every day the sun rises, charity is due on every joint of a person.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91224;Your tireless and diligent work as their ruler has not gone unnoticed by your people. Some have dubbed you 'He Who Appears Everywhere' and claim you possess supernatural powers to exist in more than one place at once.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91224;I have never been afraid of a little hard work.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91225;You have become renowned for your kind rule, and your people love you for it. There are those who would call you soft, but even they are impressed by the devotion your subjects show you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91225;The carrot, not the stick.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91226;Your ability to plan for the long-term and see the big picture has served you well as a ruler. Future generations will thank you for the work you do today!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91226;Great things come to those who wait.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91227;You always strive to be humble, never forgetting the roots of yourself and your ancestors. There are many lessons from the past that must still be heeded today.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91227;I will not forget.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91228;Your honest nature and tendency to speak what is on your mind has ruffled a few feathers in the past, but it has also earned you great respect. People know that your words ring true.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91228;The truth is the truth.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91229;Your enemies would accuse you of many things, but not even they would label you a coward. It is well known that you are fearless and always willing to share the dangers faced by your men.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91229;Never give in to fear.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91230;You are an ambitious man, always striving to improve and do better. The people know this, and though some of your decisions may be unpopular, they are usually at least seen as progressive.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91230;Why settle for mediocrity?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91231;Just and fair in all things, your people rest easy in the knowledge that no matter what, you can always be depended on to observe the rule of law.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91231;Law should govern.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91232;No one can question your devotion to Allah and the teachings of his Prophet (peace be upon him). You can always be counted on to put your faith ahead of yourself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91232;Laa ilaha ilallah!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91233;You have proven your devotion to Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) by making war against the enemies of Islam. As one of the mujahideen, you are acknowledged to have fought in a Jihad.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91233;The best jihad is the one in which your horse is slain and your blood is spilled.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91234;You have completely memorized the Quran, an accomplishment that not only shows your devotion to Allah (glorified and exalted be He), but which has also won you great respect as a ruler.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91234;It was not easy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC91235;It is a well known fact that you have completed the Hajj and thus shown your submission and devotion to Allah (may He be glorified and exalted). Whatever else they may say about you, no one can take this away.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA91235;It was my duty.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC105250;Being the Food Taster for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] can be a dangerous job. I am supposed to taste the food and drink to be served to [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] to make sure it is safe to eat, not poisonous or tastes strange.

EVTOPTA105253;[From.GetTitledFirstName] became gravely ill by the poisoned food;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB105253;The poison did not even make [From.GetTitledFirstName] sick!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC106000;A man named Al-Ghazali has returned to [Root.GetName] after seven years of studying fiqh, the expansion of the code of conduct called sharia. His scholarly interest in sufism, kalam, philosophy, logic and Islamic jurisprudence has led him to start writing a book he calls 'The Incoherence of the Philosophers' which will surely be a masterpiece when it is finished.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA88750;Very well, the fatwa shall be issued.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC89015;Though you are the first wife of [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], his current announced heir is not a child of yours. Perhaps you could talk to your husband and persuade him to grant your son more land, thus increasing his power and influence...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA89018;But... but... I didn't tell her to...!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC89020;You have toiled long and hard for your husband, [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], and even gifted him with a son.
