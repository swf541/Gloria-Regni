If we exclude Isaac, who had launched a successful coup to become Emperor in 1057, the Komnenos family were loyal servants of the Eastern Roman Empire. In the chaos following the Seljuk victory at Manzikert, the Komnenos family followed that proud family tradition and launched another coup. For the next 100 years the dynasty would halt the decline of the Eastern Roman Empire under what we know as the Komnenian restoration. Ironically, the family would be toppled in a palace coup, but they would continue to rule as Emperors in Trebizond;x;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x
